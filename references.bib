	abstract = {Abstract
          The integration of orthogonal data modalities greatly supports the interpretation of transcriptomic landscapes in complex tissues. In particular, spatially resolved gene expression profiles are key to understand tissue organization and function. However, spatial transcriptomics (ST) profiling techniques lack single-cell resolution and require a combination with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) information to deconvolute the spatially indexed datasets. Leveraging the strengths of both data types, we developed SPOTlight, a computational tool that enables the integration of ST with scRNA-seq data to infer the location of cell types and states within a complex tissue. SPOTlight is centered around a seeded non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) regression, initialized using cell-type marker genes, and non-negative least squares (NNLS) to subsequently deconvolute ST capture locations (spots). Using synthetic spots, simulating varying reference quantities and qualities, we confirmed high prediction accuracy also with shallowly sequenced or small-sized scRNA-seq reference datasets. We trained the NMF regression model with sample-matched or external datasets, resulting in accurate and sensitive spatial predictions. SPOTlight deconvolution of the mouse brain correctly mapped subtle neuronal cell states of the cortical layers and the defined architecture of the hippocampus. In human pancreatic cancer, we successfully segmented patient sections into healthy and cancerous areas, and further fine-mapped normal and neoplastic cell states. Trained on an external pancreatic tumor immune reference, we charted the localization of clinical-relevant and tumor-specific immune cell states. Using SPOTlight to detect regional enrichment of immune cells and their co-localization with tumor and adjacent stroma provides an illustrative example in its flexible application spectrum and future potential in digital pathology.},

It will help scientists understand how genetic variants impact disease risk, define drug toxicities, discover better therapies, and advance regenerative medicine. A resource of such ambition and scale should be built in stages, increasing in size, breadth, and resolution as technologies develop and understanding deepens. We will therefore pursue Phase 1 as a suite of flagship projects in key tissues, systems, and organs. We will bring together experts in biology, medicine, genomics, technology development and computation (including data analysis, software engineering, and visualization). We will also need standardized experimental and computational methods that will allow us to compare diverse cell and tissue types - and samples across human communities - in consistent ways, ensuring that the resulting resource is truly global. This document, the first version of the HCA White Paper, was written by experts in the field with feedback and suggestions from the HCA community, gathered during recent international meetings. The White Paper, released at the close of this yearlong planning process, will be a living document that evolves as the HCA community provides additional feedback, as technological and computational advances are made, and as lessons are learned during the construction of the atlas.},

          In response to antigen challenge, B cells clonally expand, undergo selection and differentiate to produce mature B cell subsets and high affinity antibodies. However, the interplay between dynamic B cell states and their antibody-based selection is challenging to decipher in primary human tissue. We have applied an integrated analysis of bulk and single-cell antibody repertoires paired with single-cell transcriptomics of human B cells undergoing affinity maturation. We define unique gene expression and antibody repertoires of known and novel B cell states, including a pre-germinal centre state primed to undergo class switch recombination. We dissect antibody class-dependent gene expression of germinal centre and memory B cells to find that class switching prior to germinal centre entry dictates the capacity of B cells to undergo antibody-based selection and differentiate. Together, our analyses provide unprecedented resolution into the gene expression and selection dynamics that shape B cell-mediated immunity.},

We exploit the natural nested structure inherent to many model components, which deﬁnes the model component to be a ﬂexible extension of a base model. Proper priors are deﬁned to penalise the complexity induced by deviating from the simpler base model and are formulated after the input of a user-deﬁned scaling parameter for that model component, both in the univariate and the multivariate case. These priors are invariant to reparameterisations, have a natural connection to Jeffreys’ priors, are designed to support Occam’s razor and seem to have excellent robustness properties, all which are highly desirable and allow us to use this approach to deﬁne default prior distributions. Through examples and theoretical results, we demonstrate the appropriateness of this approach and how it can be applied in various situations.},

These cells are far more active than was previously thought and are powerful controllers of synapse formation, function, plasticity and elimination, both in health and disease. Understanding how signalling between glia and neurons regulates synaptic development will offer new insight into how the nervous system works and provide new targets for the treatment of neurological diseases.},

	abstract = {Non-genetic transcriptional variability is a potential mechanism for therapy resistance in melanoma. Specifically, rare subpopulations of cells occupy a transient pre-resistant state characterized by coordinated high expression of several genes and survive therapy. How might these rare states arise and disappear within the population? It is unclear whether the canonical models of probabilistic transcriptional pulsing can explain this behavior, or if it requires special, hitherto unidentiﬁed mechanisms. We show that a minimal model of transcriptional bursting and gene interactions can give rise to rare coordinated high expression states. These states occur more frequently in networks with low connectivity and depend on three parameters. While entry into these states is initiated by a long transcriptional burst that also triggers entry of other genes, the exit occurs through independent inactivation of individual genes. Together, we demonstrate that established principles of gene regulation are sufﬁcient to describe this behavior and argue for its more general existence. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the Supplemental Information.},

	abstract = {The isocortex and hippocampal formation are two major structures in the mammalian brain that play critical roles in perception, cognition, emotion and learning. Both structures contain multiple regions, for many of which the cellular composition is still poorly understood. In this study, we used two complementary single-cell RNA-sequencing approaches, SMART-Seq and 10x, to profile {\textasciitilde}1.2 million cells covering all regions in the adult mouse isocortex and hippocampal formation, and derived a cell type taxonomy comprising 379 transcriptomic types. The completeness of coverage enabled us to define gene expression variations across the entire spatial landscape without significant gaps. We found that cell types are organized in a hierarchical manner and exhibit varying degrees of discrete or continuous relatedness with each other. Such molecular relationships correlate strongly with the spatial distribution patterns of the cell types, which can be region-specific, or shared across multiple regions, or part of one or more gradients along with other cell types. Glutamatergic neuron types have much greater diversity than GABAergic neuron types, both molecularly and spatially, and they define regional identities as well as inter-region relationships. For example, we found that glutamatergic cell types between the isocortex and hippocampal formation are highly distinct from each other yet possess shared molecular signatures and corresponding layer specificities, indicating their homologous relationships. Overall, our study establishes a molecular architecture of the mammalian isocortex and hippocampal formation for the first time, and begins to shed light on its underlying relationship with the development, evolution, connectivity and function of these two brain structures.},

This question has remained mostly unanswered until recently.

MISTy can be applied to different spatially resolved -omics data with dozens to thousands of markers. We evaluate the performance of MISTy on an in silico dataset and demonstrate its applicability on two breast cancer datasets measured with imaging mass cytometry and spatial transcriptomics, respectively. We show the relevance of the information extracted when separating the effect of close and distant cells.

	abstract = {Spatial transcriptomic technologies measure gene expression at increasing spatial resolution, approaching individual cells. However, a limitation of current technologies is that spatial measurements may contain contributions from multiple cells, hindering the discovery of cell type-speciﬁc spatial patterns of localization and expression. Here, we develop Robust Cell Type Decomposition (RCTD, https://github.com/dmcable/RCTD), a computational method that leverages cell type proﬁles learned from single-cell RNA sequencing data to decompose mixtures, such as those observed in spatial transcriptomic technologies. Our approach accounts for platform eﬀects introduced by systematic technical variability inherent to diﬀerent sequencing modalities. We demonstrate RCTD provides substantial improvement in cell type assignment in Slide-seq data by accurately reproducing known cell type and subtype localization patterns in the cerebellum and hippocampus.We further show the advantages of RCTD by its ability to detect mixtures and identify cell types on an assessment dataset. Finally, we show how RCTD’s recovery of cell type localization uniquely enables the discovery of genes within a cell type whose expression depends on spatial environment. Spatial mapping of cell types with RCTD has the potential to enable the deﬁnition of spatial components of cellular identity, uncovering new principles of cellular organization in biological tissue.},

	abstract = {How to model and analyze scRNA-seq data has been the subject of considerable confusion and debate. The high proportion of zero counts in a typical scRNA-seq data matrix has garnered particular attention, and lead to widespread but inconsistent use of terminology such as “dropout” and “missing data.” Here, we argue that much of this terminology is unhelpful and confusing, and outline simple ways of thinking about models for scRNA-seq data that can help avoid this confusion. The key ideas are: (1) observed scRNA-seq counts reflect both the actual expression level of each gene in each cell and the measurement process, and it is important for models to explicitly distinguish contributions from these two distinct factors; and (2) the measurement process can be adequately described by a simple Poisson model, a claim for which we provide both theoretical and empirical support. We show how these ideas lead to a simple, flexible statistical framework that encompasses a number of commonly used models and analysis methods, and how this framework makes explicit their different assumptions and helps interpret their results. We also illustrate how explicitly separating models for expression and measurement can help address questions of biological interest, such as whether mRNA expression levels are multi-modal among cells.},

To leverage these advantages, we developed a method for scRNAseq in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). We pooled diverse transcriptionally barcoded gene deletion mutants in 11 different environmental conditions and determined their expression state by sequencing 38,285 individual cells. We benchmarked a framework for learning gene regulatory networks from scRNAseq data that incorporates multitask learning and constructed a global gene regulatory network comprising 12,228 interactions.},

Retinoic acid induced early CXCL13 expression in stromal organizer cells independent of lymphotoxin signaling. Notably, neurons adjacent to the lymph node anlagen expressed enzymes essential for retinoic acid synthesis. Furthermore, stimulation of parasymphathetic neural output in adults led to a retinoic acid receptor-dependent induction of CXCL13 in the gut. Therefore, our data show that initiation of lymph node development is controlled by retinoic acid-mediated expression of CXCL13 and suggest that retinoic acid may be provided by adjacent neurons.},

Here we showed that, when engaged by the ensemble of bystander B cells constitutively expressing PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), PD-1 inhibited T cell recruitment into the follicle. This inhibition involved suppression of PI3K activities downstream of the follicleguidance receptor CXCR5, was independent of co-signaling with the TCR, and necessitated ICOS signaling to overcome. PD-1 further restricted CXCR3 upregulation on Tfh cells, serving to concentrate these cells toward the germinal center territory, where PD-L1-PD-1 interactions between individual Tfh and B cells optimized B cell competition and afﬁnity maturation. Therefore, operating in both costimulation-independent and -dependent manners, PD-1 controls tissue positioning and function of Tfh cells.},

            During organogenesis, patterns and gradients of gene expression underlie organization and diversified cell specification to generate complex tissue architecture. While the cerebral cortex is organized into six excitatory neuronal layers, it is unclear whether glial cells are diversified to mimic neuronal laminae or show distinct layering. To determine the molecular architecture of the mammalian cortex, we developed a high content pipeline that can quantify single-cell gene expression
            in situ
            . The Large-area Spatial Transcriptomic (LaST) map confirmed expected cortical neuron layer organization and also revealed a novel neuronal identity signature. Screening 46 candidate genes for astrocyte diversity across the cortex, we identified grey matter superficial, mid and deep astrocyte identities in gradient layer patterns that were distinct from neurons. Astrocyte layers formed in early postnatal cortex and mostly persisted in adult mouse and human cortex. Mutations that shifted neuronal post-mitotic identity or organization were sufficient to alter glial layering, indicating an instructive role for neuronal cues. In normal mouse cortex, astrocyte layer patterns showed area diversity between functionally distinct cortical regions. These findings indicate that excitatory neurons and astrocytes cells are organized into distinct lineage-associated laminae, which give rise to higher order neuroglial complexity of cortical architecture.},

Algorithms now attempt to integrate patterns across these studies by removing all study-specific information, without distinguishing unwanted technical bias from relevant biological variation. Integration remains difficult when capturing biological variation that is distributed across studies, as when combining disparate temporal snapshots into a panoramic, multi-study trajectory of cellular development. Here, we show that a fundamental analytic shift to gene coexpression within clusters of cells, rather than gene expression within individual cells, balances robustness to bias with preservation of meaningful inter-study differences. We leverage this insight in Trajectorama, an algorithm which we use to unify trajectories of neuronal development and hematopoiesis across studies that each profile separate developmental stages, a highly challenging task for existing methods. Trajectorama also reveals systems-level processes relevant to disease pathogenesis within the microglial response to myelin injury. Trajectorama benefits from efficiency and scalability, processing nearly one million cells in around an hour.},

Arbitrary covariates and prior hierarchies are supported to leverage complex experimental designs.

SLiMs usually occur in structurally disordered regions and mediate low afﬁnity interactions. Most SLiMs are 3–15 amino acids in length and have 2–5 deﬁned positions, making them highly likely to occur by chance and extremely difﬁcult to identify. Nevertheless, our knowledge of SLiMs and capacity to predict them from protein sequence data using computational methods has advanced dramatically over the past decade. By considering the biological, structural, and evolutionary context of SLiM occurrences, it is possible to differentiate functional instances from chance matches in many cases and to identify new regions of proteins that have the features consistent with a SLiM-mediated interaction. Their simplicity also makes SLiMs evolutionarily labile and prone to independent origins on different sequence backgrounds through convergent evolution, which can be exploited for predicting novel SLiMs in proteins that share a function or interaction partner.},

The motifs typically reside in the disordered regions of the proteome and the interactions are often transient, allowing for rapid changes in response to changing stimuli. The properties that make domain-motif interactions suitable for cell signaling also make them difficult to capture experimentally and they are therefore largely underrepresented in the known protein-protein interaction networks. Most of the knowledge on domain-motif interactions is derived from low-throughput studies, although there exist dedicated high-throughput methods for the identification of domain-motif interactions. The methods include arrays of peptides or proteins, display of peptides on phage or yeast, and yeast-two-hybrid experiments. We here provide a survey of scalable methods for domain-motif interaction profiling. These methods have frequently been applied to a limited number of ubiquitous domain families. It is now time to apply them to a broader set of peptide binding proteins, to provide a comprehensive picture of the linear motifs in the human proteome and to link them to their potential binding partners. Despite the plethora of methods, it is still a challenge for most approaches to identify interactions that rely on post-translational modification or context dependent or conditional interactions, suggesting directions for further method development.},

	abstract = {High-throughput in vitro methods have been extensively applied to identify linear information that encodes peptide recognition. However, these methods are limited in number of peptides, sequence variation, and length of peptides that can be explored, and often produce solutions that are not found in the cell. Despite the large number of methods developed to attempt addressing these issues, the exhaustive search of linear information encoding protein-peptide recognition has been so far physically unfeasible. Here, we describe a strategy, called DALEL, for the exhaustive search of linear sequence information encoded in proteins that bind to a common partner. We applied DALEL to explore binding specificity of SH3 domains in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using only the polypeptide sequences of SH3 domain binding proteins, we succeeded in identifying the majority of known SH3 binding sites previously discovered either in vitro or in vivo. Moreover, we discovered a number of sites with both non-canonical sequences and distinct properties that may serve ancillary roles in peptide recognition. We compared DALEL to a variety of stateof-the-art algorithms in the blind identification of known binding sites of the human Grb2 SH3 domain. We also benchmarked DALEL on curated biological motifs derived from the ELM database to evaluate the effect of increasing/decreasing the enrichment of the motifs. Our strategy can be applied in conjunction with experimental data of proteins interacting with a common partner to identify binding sites among them. Yet, our strategy can also be applied to any group of proteins of interest to identify enriched linear motifs or to exhaustively explore the space of linear information encoded in a polypeptide sequence. Finally, we have developed a webserver located at http://michnick.bcm.umontreal.ca/dalel, offering user-friendly interface and providing different scenarios utilizing DALEL.},

	abstract = {The mouse inner cell mass (ICM) segregates into the epiblast and primitive endoderm (PrE) lineages coincident with implantation of the embryo. The epiblast subsequently undergoes considerable expansion of cell numbers prior to gastrulation. To investigate underlying regulatory principles, we performed systematic single-cell RNA sequencing (seq) of conceptuses from E3.5 to E6.5. The epiblast shows reactivation and subsequent inactivation of the X chromosome, with Zfp57 expression associated with reactivation and inactivation together with other candidate regulators. At E6.5, the transition from epiblast to primitive streak is linked with decreased expression of polycomb subunits, suggesting a key regulatory role. Notably, our analyses suggest elevated transcriptional noise at E3.5 and within the non-committed epiblast at E6.5, coinciding with exit from pluripotency. By contrast, E6.5 primitive streak cells became highly synchronized and exhibit a shortened G1 cellcycle phase, consistent with accelerated proliferation. Our study systematically charts transcriptional noise and uncovers molecular processes associated with early lineage decisions.},

	abstract = {Background: Short linear motifs in host organisms proteins can be mimicked by viruses to create protein-protein interactions that disable or control metabolic pathways. Given that viral linear motif instances of host motif regular expressions can be found by chance, it is necessary to develop filtering methods of functional linear motifs. We conduct a systematic comparison of linear motifs filtering methods to develop a computational approach for predictin g motif-mediated protein-protein interactions between human and the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1).
Results: We implemented three filtering methods to obtain linear motif sets: 1) conserved in viral proteins (C), 2) located in disordered regions (D) and 3) rare or scarce in a set of randomized viral sequences (R). The sets C, D, R are united and intersected. The resulting sets are compared by the number of protein-protein interactions correctly inferred with them – with experimental validation. The comparison is done with HIV-1 sequences and interactions from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). The number of correctly inferred interactions allows to rank the interactions by the sets used to deduce them: D ∪ R and C. The ordering of the sets is descending on the probability of capturing functional interactions. With respect to HIV-1, the sets C ∪R, D∪R, C ∪D∪R infer all known interactions between HIV1 and human proteins med iated by linear motifs. We found that the majority of conserved linear motifs in the virus are located in disordered regions.
Conclusion: We have developed a method for predicting protein-protein interactions mediated by linear motifs between HIV-1 and human proteins. The method only use protein sequences as inputs. We can extend the software developed to any other eukaryotic virus and host in order to find and rank candidate interactions. In future works we will use it to explore possible viral attack mechanisms based on linear motif mimicry.},

	url = {http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/111971},
	abstract = {A signaling pathway transmits information from an upstream system to downstream systems, ideally in a unidirectional fashion. A key obstacle to unidirectional transmission is retroactivity, the additional reaction ﬂux that aﬀects a system once its species interact with those of downstream systems. This raises the fundamental question of whether signaling pathways have developed specialized architectures that overcome retroactivity and transmit unidirectional signals. Here, we propose a general procedure based on mathematical analysis that provides an answer to this question. Using this procedure, we analyze the ability of a variety of signaling architectures to transmit one-way (from upstream to downstream) signals, as key biological parameters are tuned. We ﬁnd that single stage phosphorylation and phosphotransfer systems that transmit signals from a kinase show a stringent design trade-oﬀ that hampers their ability to overcome retroactivity. Interestingly, cascades of these architectures, which are highly represented in nature, can overcome this trade-oﬀ and thus enable unidirectional transmission. By contrast, phosphotransfer systems, and single and double phosphorylation cycles that transmit signals from a substrate are unable to mitigate retroactivity eﬀects, even when cascaded, and hence are not well suited for unidirectional information transmission. Our results identify signaling architectures that, allowing unidirectional transmission of signals, embody modular processes that conserve their input/output behavior across multiple contexts. These ﬁndings can be used to decompose natural signal transduction networks into modules, and, at the same time, they establish a library of devices that can be used in synthetic biology to facilitate modular circuit design.},

Unexpectedly, we ﬁnd that aged mice remain behaviorally circadian and that their epidermal and muscle stem cells retain a robustly rhythmic core circadian machinery. However, the oscillating transcriptome is extensively reprogrammed in aged stem cells, switching from genes involved in homeostasis to those involved in tissue-speciﬁc stresses, such as DNA damage or inefﬁcient autophagy. Importantly, deletion of circadian clock components did not reproduce the hallmarks of this reprogramming, underscoring that rewiring, rather than arrhythmia, is associated with physiological aging. While age-associated rewiring of the oscillatory diurnal transcriptome is not recapitulated by a high-fat diet in young adult mice, it is signiﬁcantly prevented by long-term caloric restriction in aged mice. Thus, stem cells rewire their diurnal timed functions to adapt to metabolic cues and to tissue-speciﬁc age-related traits.},

These age-dependent changes occur in a highly tissue-speciﬁc manner, as demonstrated by comparing circadian gene expression in the liver versus epidermal and skeletal muscle stem cells. Moreover, de novo oscillating genes under CR show an enrichment in SIRT1 targets in the liver. This is accompanied by distinct circadian hepatic signatures in NAD+-related metabolites and cyclic global protein acetylation. Strikingly, this oscillation in acetylation is absent in old mice while CR robustly rescues global protein acetylation. Our ﬁndings indicate that the clock operates at the crossroad between protein acetylation, liver metabolism, and aging.},

Here, we perform a targeted screen for kinase inhibitors, which modulate the naive-primed pluripotent transition. We ﬁnd that XMD compounds, which selectively inhibit Erk5 kinase and BET bromodomain family proteins, drive ESCs toward primed pluripotency. Using compound selectivity engineering and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, we reveal distinct functions for Erk5 and Brd4 in pluripotency regulation. We show that Erk5 signaling maintains ESCs in the naive state and suppresses progression toward primed pluripotency and neuroectoderm differentiation. Additionally, we identify a specialized role for Erk5 in deﬁning ESC lineage selection, whereby Erk5 inhibits a cardiomyocyte-speciﬁc differentiation program. Our data therefore reveal multiple critical functions for Erk5 in controlling ESC identity.},

            and further shed light on how transcriptional networks are rewired throughout evolution. Here, we present a novel sequencing-based TF binding assay and analysis pipeline capable of providing quantitative estimates of binding energies for more than one million DNA sequences in parallel at high energetic resolution. Using this platform, we measured the binding energies associated with all possible combinations of 10 nucleotides flanking the known consensus DNA target for two model yeast TFs, Pho4 and Cbf1. A large fraction of these flanking mutations change overall binding energies by an amount equal to or greater than consensus site mutations, suggesting that current definitions of TF binding sites may be too restrictive. By systematically comparing estimates of binding energies output by deep neural networks (NN) and biophysical models trained on these data, we establish that dinucleotide specificities are sufficient to explain essentially all variance in observed binding behavior, with Cbf1 binding exhibiting significantly more epistasis than Pho4. NN-derived binding energies agree with orthogonal biochemical measurements and reveal that dynamically occupied sites

We observe that cells pass from the pluripotent state to the neuronal state via an intermediate epiblast-like state. However, analysis of the rate at which cells enter and exit these observed cell states using a hidden Markov model indicates the presence of a chain of unobserved molecular states that each cell transits through stochastically in sequence. This chain of hidden states allows individual cells to record their position on the differentiation trajectory, thereby encoding a simple form of cellular memory. We suggest a statistical mechanics interpretation of these results that distinguishes between functionally distinct cellular ‘‘macrostates’’ and functionally similar molecular ‘‘microstates’’ and propose a model of stem cell differentiation as a non-Markov stochastic process.},

Here, we explore the effects of degrading cohesin. All loop domains are eliminated, but neither compartment domains nor histone marks are affected. Loss of loop domains does not lead to widespread ectopic gene activation but does affect a signiﬁcant minority of active genes. In particular, cohesin loss causes superenhancers to co-localize, forming hundreds of links within and across chromosomes and affecting the regulation of nearby genes. We then restore cohesin and monitor the re-formation of each loop.

We validated these predictions in an independent 100-person cohort. Finally, a blinded randomized controlled dietary intervention based on this algorithm resulted in signiﬁcantly lower postprandial responses and consistent alterations to gut microbiota conﬁguration.

Binding of activators and repressors increase and reduce transcription, respectively, but it is not understood how combinations of activators and repressors generate precise patterns of transcription during development. Here, we explore this problem using a fully synthetic transcriptional platform in Drosophila consisting of engineered transcription factor gradients and artiﬁcial enhancers. We found that binding sites for a transcription factor that makes DNA accessible are required together with binding sites for transcriptional activators to produce a functional enhancer. Only in this context can changes in the number of activator binding sites mediate quantitative control of transcription. Using an engineered transcriptional repressor gradient, we demonstrate that overlapping repressor and activator binding sites provide more robust repression and sharper expression boundaries than non-overlapping sites. This may explain why this common motif is observed in many developmental enhancers.},

We present a comprehensive analysis of eukaryotic linear motifs (ELMs) in 2,208 viral genomes and reveal that viruses exploit molecular mimicry of host-like ELMs to possibly assist in host-virus interactions. Using a statistical genomics approach, we identify a large number of potentially functional ELMs and observe that the occurrence of ELMs is often evolutionarily conserved but not uniform across virus families. Some viral proteins contain multiple types of ELMs, in striking similarity to complex regulatory modules in host proteins, suggesting that ELMs may act combinatorially to assist viral replication. Furthermore, a simple evolutionary model suggests that the inherent structural simplicity of ELMs often enables them to tolerate mutations and evolve quickly. Our ﬁndings suggest that ELMs may allow fast rewiring of host-virus interactions, which likely assists rapid viral evolution and adaptation to diverse environments.},

Transcription factors (TFs) are the main link between signalling pathways and the transcriptional regulatory machinery of the cell, positioning them as key oncogenic inductors and therefore potential targets of therapeutic intervention. We implemented a computational pipeline to infer TF regulatory activities from basal gene expression and applied it to publicly available and newly generated RNA-seq data from a collection of 1,010 cancer cell lines and 9,250 primary tumors. We show that the predicted TF activities recapitulate known mechanisms of transcriptional dysregulation in cancer and dissect mutant-specific effects in driver genes. Importantly, we show the potential for predicted TF activities to be used as markers of sensitivity to the inhibition of their upstream regulators. Furthermore, combining these inferred activities with existing pharmacogenomic markers significantly improves the stratification of sensitive and resistant cell lines for several compounds. Our approach provides a framework to link driver genomic alterations with transcriptional dysregulation that helps to predict drug sensitivity in cancer and to dissect its mechanistic determinants.},

More generally, network architecture reﬂects cellular localization, biological process, and molecular function, enabling functional characterization of thousands of proteins. Network structure also reveals associations among thousands of protein domains, suggesting a basis for examining structurally related proteins. Finally, BioPlex, in combination with other approaches, can be used to reveal interactions of biological or clinical signiﬁcance. For example, mutations in the membrane protein VAPB implicated in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis perturb a deﬁned community of interactors.},

In this study, we investigate gene expression and regulation across 38 tissues proﬁled in the Genotype-Tissue Expression project. We ﬁnd that network edges (transcription factor to target gene connections) have higher tissue speciﬁcity than network nodes (genes) and that regulating nodes (transcription factors) are less likely to be expressed in a tissue-speciﬁc manner as compared to their targets (genes). Gene set enrichment analysis of network targeting also indicates that the regulation of tissue-speciﬁc function is largely independent of transcription factor expression. In addition, tissue-speciﬁc genes are not highly targeted in their corresponding tissue network. However, they do assume bottleneck positions due to variability in transcription factor targeting and the inﬂuence of non-canonical regulatory interactions. These results suggest that tissue speciﬁcity is driven by context-dependent regulatory paths, providing transcriptional control of tissue-speciﬁc processes.},

We demonstrate that a histone deacetylase (Hdac3) organizes heterochromatin at the nuclear lamina during cardiac progenitor lineage restriction. Speciﬁcation of cardiomyocytes is associated with reorganization of peripheral heterochromatin, and independent of deacetylase activity, Hdac3 tethers peripheral heterochromatin containing lineage-relevant genes to the nuclear lamina. Deletion of Hdac3 in cardiac progenitor cells releases genomic regions from the nuclear periphery, leading to precocious cardiac gene expression and differentiation into cardiomyocytes; in contrast, restricting Hdac3 to the nuclear periphery rescues myogenesis in progenitors otherwise lacking Hdac3. Our results suggest that availability of genomic regions for activation by lineage-speciﬁc factors is regulated in part through dynamic chromatin-nuclear lamina interactions and that competence of a progenitor cell to respond to differentiation signals may depend upon coordinated movement of responding gene loci away from the nuclear periphery.},

Together with genetic perturbations, this reveals a transcriptional network that integrates opposing retinoic acid (RA) and Wnt signals to determine the rate at which cells enter and exit the NMP state. RA, produced by newly generated mesodermal cells, provides feedback that initiates NMP generation and induces neural differentiation, thereby coordinating the production of neural and mesodermal tissue.

	abstract = {Background: Human pluripotent stem cells offer the best available model to study the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of human embryonic lineage specification. However, it is not fully understood how individual stem cells exit the pluripotent state and transition towards their respective progenitor states.
Results: Here, we analyze the transcriptomes of human embryonic stem cell-derived lineage-specific progenitors by single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). We identify a definitive endoderm (DE) transcriptomic signature that leads us to pinpoint a critical time window when DE differentiation is enhanced by hypoxia. The molecular mechanisms governing the emergence of DE are further examined by time course scRNA-seq experiments, employing two new statistical tools to identify stage-specific genes over time (SCPattern) and to reconstruct the differentiation trajectory from the pluripotent state through mesendoderm to DE (Wave-Crest). Importantly, presumptive DE cells can be detected during the transitory phase from Brachyury (T)+ mesendoderm toward a CXCR4+ DE state. Novel regulators are identified within this time window and are functionally validated on a screening platform with a T-2A-EGFP knock-in reporter engineered by CRISPR/Cas9. Through loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments, we demonstrate that KLF8 plays a pivotal role modulating mesendoderm to DE differentiation.
Conclusions: We report the analysis of 1776 cells by scRNA-seq covering distinct human embryonic stem cell-derived progenitor states. By reconstructing a differentiation trajectory at single-cell resolution, novel regulators of the mesendoderm transition to DE are elucidated and validated. Our strategy of combining single-cell analysis and genetic approaches can be applied to uncover novel regulators governing cell fate decisions in a variety of systems.},

After a dramatic drop after World War II, research on tropical diseases have received more attention and research funding in the twenty-first century.
Methods: We used Apache Taverna to integrate Europe PMC and MapAffil web services, containing the spatiotemporal analysis workflow from a list of PubMed queries to a list of publication years and author affiliations geoparsed to latitudes and longitudes. The results could then be visualized in the Quantum Geographic Information System (QGIS).
Results: Our workflows automatically matched 253,277 affiliations to geographical coordinates for the first authors of 379,728 papers on tropical diseases in a single execution. The bibliometric analyses show how research output in tropical diseases follow major historical shifts in the twentieth century and renewed interest in and funding for tropical disease research in the twenty-first century. They show the effects of disease outbreaks, WHO eradication programs, vaccine developments, wars, refugee migrations, and peace treaties.
Conclusions: Literature search and geoparsing web services can be combined in scientific workflows performing a complete spatiotemporal bibliometric analyses of research in tropical medicine. The workflows and datasets are freely available and can be used to reproduce or refine the analyses and test specific hypotheses or look into particular diseases or geographic regions. This work exceeds all previously published bibliometric analyses on tropical diseases in both scale and spatiotemporal range.},

Here, we describe PHOTON, a method for interpreting phosphorylation data within their signaling context, as captured by protein-protein interaction networks, to identify active proteins and pathways and pinpoint functional phosphosites. We apply PHOTON to interpret existing and novel phosphoproteomic datasets related to epidermal growth factor and insulin responses. PHOTON substantially outperforms the widely used cutoff approach, providing highly reproducible predictions that are more in line with current biological knowledge. Altogether, PHOTON overcomes the fundamental challenge of delineating signaling pathways from large-scale phosphoproteomic data, thereby enabling translation of environmental cues to downstream cellular responses.},

	abstract = {Naked mole rat (NMR) is a valuable model for aging and cancer research due to its exceptional longevity and cancer resistance. We observed that the reprogramming efﬁciency of NMR ﬁbroblasts in response to OSKM was drastically lower than that of mouse ﬁbroblasts. Expression of SV40 LargeT antigen (LT) dramatically improved reprogramming of NMR ﬁbroblasts. Inactivation of Rb alone, but not p53, was sufﬁcient to improve reprogramming efﬁciency, suggesting that NMR chromatin may be refractory to reprogramming. Analysis of the global histone landscape revealed that NMR had higher levels of repressive H3K27 methylation marks and lower levels of activating H3K27 acetylation marks than mouse. ATAC-seq revealed that in NMR, promoters of reprogramming genes were more closed than mouse promoters, while expression of LT led to massive opening of the NMR promoters. These results suggest that NMR displays a more stable epigenome that resists de-differentiation, contributing to the cancer resistance and longevity of this species.},

Here, we perform an integrative analysis of the structural, interactomic, and regulatory properties of thousands of putative fusion proteins. We demonstrate that genes that form fusions (i.e., parent genes) tend to be highly connected hub genes, whose protein products are enriched in structured and disordered interaction-mediating features. Fusion often results in the loss of these parental features and the depletion of regulatory sites such as post-translational modiﬁcations. Fusion products disproportionately connect proteins that did not previously interact in the protein interaction network. In this manner, fusion products can escape cellular regulation and constitutively rewire protein interaction networks. We suggest that the deregulation of central, interaction-prone proteins may represent a widespread mechanism by which fusion proteins alter the topology of cellular signaling pathways and promote cancer.},

The essential machines are protein complexes that effect regulatory decisions by undergoing internal changes of state. Subcomponents of these cellular complexes are assembled into molecular switches. Many of these switches employ one or more short peptide motifs as toggles that can move between one or more sites within the switch system, the simplest being on-off switches. Paradoxically, these motif modules (termed short linear motifs or SLiMs) are both hugely abundant but difficult to research. So despite the many successes in identifying short regulatory protein motifs, it is thought that only the “tip of the iceberg” has been exposed. Experimental and bioinformatic motif discovery remain challenging and error prone. The advice presented in this article is aimed at helping researchers to uncover genuine protein motifs, whilst avoiding the pitfalls that lead to reports of false discovery.},

	abstract = {Synthetic biology efforts have largely focused on small engineered gene networks, yet understanding how to integrate multiple synthetic modules and interface them with endogenous pathways remains a challenge. Here we present the design, system integration, and analysis of several large scale synthetic gene circuits for artificial tissue homeostasis. Diabetes therapy represents a possible application for engineered homeostasis, where genetically programmed stem cells maintain a steady population of b-cells despite continuous turnover. We develop a new iterative process that incorporates modular design principles with hierarchical performance optimization targeted for environments with uncertainty and incomplete information. We employ theoretical analysis and computational simulations of multicellular reaction/diffusion models to design and understand system behavior, and find that certain features often associated with robustness (e.g., multicellular synchronization and noise attenuation) are actually detrimental for tissue homeostasis. We overcome these problems by engineering a new class of genetic modules for ‘synthetic cellular heterogeneity’ that function to generate beneficial population diversity. We design two such modules (an asynchronous genetic oscillator and a signaling throttle mechanism), demonstrate their capacity for enhancing robust control, and provide guidance for experimental implementation with various computational techniques. We found that designing modules for synthetic heterogeneity can be complex, and in general requires a framework for non-linear and multifactorial analysis. Consequently, we adapt a ‘phenotypic sensitivity analysis’ method to determine how functional module behaviors combine to achieve optimal system performance. We ultimately combine this analysis with Bayesian network inference to extract critical, causal relationships between a module’s biochemical rate-constants, its high level functional behavior in isolation, and its impact on overall system performance once integrated.},

We demonstrate Perturb-seq by analyzing 200,000 cells in immune cells and cell lines, focusing on transcription factors regulating the response of dendritic cells to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Perturb-seq accurately identiﬁes individual gene targets, gene signatures, and cell states affected by individual perturbations and their genetic interactions. We posit new functions for regulators of differentiation, the anti-viral response, and mitochondrial function during immune activation. By decomposing many high content measurements into the effects of perturbations, their interactions, and diverse cell metadata, Perturb-seq dramatically increases the scope of pooled genomic assays.},

We have developed CellNet, a network biology platform that more accurately assesses the ﬁdelity of cellular engineering than existing methodologies and generates hypotheses for improving cell derivations. Analyzing expression data from 56 published reports, we found that cells derived via directed differentiation more closely resemble their in vivo counterparts than products of direct conversion, as reﬂected by the establishment of target cell-type gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Furthermore, we discovered that directly converted cells fail to adequately silence expression programs of the starting population and that the establishment of unintended GRNs is common to virtually every cellular engineering paradigm. CellNet provides a platform for quantifying how closely engineered cell populations resemble their target cell type and a rational strategy to guide enhanced cellular engineering.},

Among alternatively spliced exons, tissue-speciﬁc exons play a critical role in maintaining tissue identity. This raises the question of how tissue-speciﬁc protein-coding exons inﬂuence protein function. Here we investigate the structural, functional, interaction, and evolutionary properties of constitutive, tissue-speciﬁc, and other alternative exons in human. We ﬁnd that tissuespeciﬁc protein segments often contain disordered regions, are enriched in posttranslational modiﬁcation sites, and frequently embed conserved binding motifs. Furthermore, genes containing tissue-speciﬁc exons tend to occupy central positions in interaction networks and display distinct interaction partners in the respective tissues, and are enriched in signaling, development, and disease genes. Based on these ﬁndings, we propose that tissue-speciﬁc inclusion of disordered segments that contain binding motifs rewires interaction networks and signaling pathways. In this way, tissue-speciﬁc splicing may contribute to functional versatility of proteins and increases the diversity of interaction networks across tissues.},

We comprehensively mapped 3D chromatin organization during mouse neural differentiation in vitro and in vivo, generating the highest-resolution Hi-C maps available to date. We found that transcription is correlated with chromatin insulation and longrange interactions, but dCas9-mediated activation is insufﬁcient for creating TAD boundaries de novo. Additionally, we discovered long-range contacts between gene bodies of exon-rich, active genes in all cell types. During neural differentiation, contacts between active TADs become less pronounced while inactive TADs interact more strongly. An extensive Polycomb network in stem cells is disrupted, while dynamic interactions between neural transcription factors appear in vivo. Finally, cell type-speciﬁc enhancer-promoter contacts are established concomitant to gene expression.

	abstract = {Humans are composed of hundreds of cell types. As the genomic DNA of each somatic cell is identical, cell type is determined by what is expressed and when. Until recently, little has been reported about the determinants of human cell identity, particularly from the joint perspective of gene evolution and expression. Here, we chart the evolutionary past of all documented human cell types via the collective histories of proteins, the principal product of gene expression. FANTOM5 data provide cell-type–speciﬁc digital expression of human protein-coding genes and the SUPERFAMILY resource is used to provide protein domain annotation. The evolutionary epoch in which each protein was created is inferred by comparison with domain annotation of all other completely sequenced genomes. Studying the distribution across epochs of genes expressed in each cell type reveals insights into human cellular evolution in terms of protein innovation. For each cell type, its history of protein innovation is charted based on the genes it expresses. Combining the histories of all cell types enables us to create a timeline of cell evolution. This timeline identiﬁes the possibility that our common ancestor Coelomata (cavity-forming animals) provided the innovation required for the innate immune system, whereas cells which now form the brain of human have followed a trajectory of continually accumulating novel proteins since Opisthokonta (boundary of animals and fungi). We conclude that exaptation of existing domain architectures into new contexts is the dominant source of cell-type–speciﬁc domain architectures.},

To gain deeper insight into the gene expression program of murine HSCs, we combined single-cell functional assays with ﬂow cytometric index sorting and single-cell gene expression assays. Through bioinformatic integration of these datasets, we designed an unbiased sorting strategy that separates non-HSCs away from HSCs, and single-cell transplantation experiments using the enriched population were combined with RNA-seq data to identify key molecules that associate with long-term durable self-renewal, producing a single-cell molecular dataset that is linked to functional stem cell activity. Finally, we demonstrated the broader applicability of this approach for linking key molecules with deﬁned cellular functions in another stem cell system.},

Our experiments distinguish cell activation versus differentiation in a quantitative framework. We demonstrate that these two processes are tightly coupled and are jointly controlled by many transcription factors, metabolic genes and cytokine/receptor pairs. There is only a small number of genes regulating differentiation without any role in activation. Our study provides an atlas for the T helper cell regulatory network, pinpointing key players of Th2 differentiation and demonstrating remarkable plasticity between the diverse T helper cell fates.

	abstract = {Short sequence motifs are ubiquitous across the three major types of biomolecules: hundreds of classes and thousands of instances of DNA regulatory elements, RNA motifs and protein short linear motifs (SLiMs) have been characterised. The increase in complexity of transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational regulation in higher Eukaryotes has coincided with a significant expansion of motif use. But how did the eukaryotic cell acquire such a vast repertoire of motifs? In this review, we curate the available literature on protein motif evolution and discuss the evidence that suggests SLiMs can be acquired by mutations, insertions and deletions in disordered regions. We propose a mechanism of ex nihilo SLiM evolution – the evolution of a novel SLiM from “nothing” –adding a functional module to a previously non-functional region of protein sequence. In our model, hundreds of motif-binding domains in higher eukaryotic proteins connect simple motif specificities with useful functions to create a large functional motif space. Accessible peptides that match the specificity of these motif-binding domains are continuously created and destroyed by mutations in rapidly evolving disordered regions, creating a dynamic supply of new interactions that may have advantageous phenotypic novelty. This provides a reservoir of diversity to modify existing interaction networks. Evolutionary pressures will act on these motifs to retain beneficial instances. However, most will be lost on an evolutionary timescale as negative selection and genetic drift act on deleterious and neutral motifs respectively. In light of the parallels between the presented model and the evolution of motifs in the regulatory segments of genes and (pre-)mRNAs, we suggest our understanding of regulatory networks would benefit from the creation of a shared model describing the evolution of transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational regulation.},

These are based on genetic engineering of human genomic safe harbors combined with an improved tetracycline-inducible system and CRISPR/Cas9 technology. We exemplify the efficacy of these methods in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), and show that generation of sOPTiKD/KO hPSCs is simple, rapid and allows tightly controlled individual or multiplexed gene knockdown or knockout in hPSCs and in a wide variety of differentiated cells. Finally, we illustrate the general applicability of this approach by investigating the function of transcription factors (OCT4 and T), cell cycle regulators (cyclin D family members) and epigenetic modifiers (DPY30). Overall, sOPTiKD and sOPTiKO provide a unique opportunity for functional analyses in multiple cell types relevant for the study of human development.},

However, technical challenges have impaired the study of the molecular interactions coordinating cell fate choice and cell-cycle progression. Here, we bypass these limitations by using the FUCCI reporter system in human pluripotent stem cells and show that their capacity of differentiation varies during the progression of their cell cycle. These mechanisms are governed by the cell-cycle regulators cyclin D1–3 that control differentiation signals such as the TGFb-Smad2/3 pathway. Conversely, cell-cycle manipulation using a small molecule directs differentiation of hPSCs and provides an approach to generate cell types with a clinical interest. Our results demonstrate that cell fate decisions are tightly associated with the cell-cycle machinery and reveal insights in the mechanisms synchronizing differentiation and proliferation in developing tissues.},

The robust substrate specificity of the APC/C prevents the potentially deleterious degradation of non-APC/C substrates, and also averts the cell cycle errors and genomic instability that could result from mistimed degradation of APC/C targets. The APC/C recognizes short linear sequence motifs, or degrons, on its substrates. The specific and timely modification and degradation of APC/C substrates is likely to be modulated by variations in degron sequence and context. We discuss the extensive affinity, specificity and selectivity determinants encoded in APC/C degrons, and we describe some of the extrinsic mechanisms that control APC/C-substrate recognition. As an archetype for protein motif-driven regulation of cell function, the APC/C-substrate interaction provides insights into the general properties of posttranslational regulatory systems.},

	abstract = {A substantial portion of the regulatory interactions in the higher eukaryotic cell are mediated by simple sequence motifs in the regulatory segments of genes and (pre-)mRNAs, and in the intrinsically disordered regions of proteins. Although these regulatory modules are physicochemically distinct, they share an evolutionary plasticity that has facilitated a rapid growth of their use and resulted in their ubiquity in complex organisms. The ease of motif acquisition simplifies access to basal housekeeping functions, facilitates the co-regulation of multiple biomolecules allowing them to respond in a coordinated manner to changes in the cell state, and supports the integration of multiple signals for combinatorial decision-making. Consequently, motifs are indispensable for temporal, spatial, conditional and basal regulation at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational level. In this review, we highlight that many of the key regulatory pathways of the cell are recruited by motifs and that the ease of motif acquisition has resulted in large networks of co-regulated biomolecules. We discuss how co-operativity allows simple static motifs to perform the conditional regulation that underlies decision-making in higher eukaryotic biological systems. We observe that each gene and its products have a unique set of DNA, RNA or protein motifs that encode a regulatory program to define the logical circuitry that guides the life cycle of these biomolecules, from transcription to degradation. Finally, we contrast the regulatory properties of protein motifs and the regulatory elements of DNA and (pre-)mRNAs, advocating that co-regulation, co-operativity, and motif-driven regulatory programs are common mechanisms that emerge from the use of simple, evolutionarily plastic regulatory modules.},

Here, we report Barcode Fusion Genetics-Yeast Two-Hybrid (BFGY2H), by which a full matrix of protein pairs can be screened in a single multiplexed strain pool. BFG-Y2H uses Cre recombination to fuse DNA barcodes from distinct plasmids, generating chimeric protein-pair barcodes that can be quantified via next-generation sequencing. We applied BFG-Y2H to four different matrices ranging in scale from {\textasciitilde}25 K to 2.5 M protein pairs.

	abstract = {The Notch signaling pathway comprises multiple ligands that are used in distinct biological contexts. In principle, different ligands could activate distinct target programs in signal-receiving cells, but it is unclear how such ligand discrimination could occur. Here, we show that cells use dynamics to discriminate signaling by the ligands Dll1 and Dll4 through the Notch1 receptor. Quantitative single-cell imaging revealed that Dll1 activates Notch1 in discrete, frequency-modulated pulses that speciﬁcally upregulate the Notch target gene Hes1. By contrast, Dll4 activates Notch1 in a sustained, amplitude-modulated manner that predominantly upregulates Hey1 and HeyL. Ectopic expression of Dll1 or Dll4 in chick neural crest produced opposite effects on myogenic differentiation, showing that ligand discrimination can occur in vivo. Finally, analysis of chimeric ligands suggests that ligand-receptor clustering underlies dynamic encoding of ligand identity. The ability of the pathway to utilize ligands as distinct communication channels has implications for diverse Notchdependent processes.},

	title = {{TMeitmhodeolDogey} alraticyle-{ARACNE}: {Reverse} engineering of gene networks from time-course data by an information theoretic approach},
	abstract = {Background: One of main aims of Molecular Biology is the gain of knowledge about how molecular components interact each other and to understand gene function regulations. Using microarray technology, it is possible to extract measurements of thousands of genes into a single analysis step having a picture of the cell gene expression. Several methods have been developed to infer gene networks from steady-state data, much less literature is produced about time-course data, so the development of algorithms to infer gene networks from time-series measurements is a current challenge into bioinformatics research area. In order to detect dependencies between genes at different time delays, we propose an approach to infer gene regulatory networks from time-series measurements starting from a well known algorithm based on information theory.
Results: In this paper we show how the ARACNE (Algorithm for the Reconstruction of Accurate Cellular Networks) algorithm can be used for gene regulatory network inference in the case of time-course expression profiles. The resulting method is called TimeDelay-ARACNE. It just tries to extract dependencies between two genes at different time delays, providing a measure of these dependencies in terms of mutual information. The basic idea of the proposed algorithm is to detect time-delayed dependencies between the expression profiles by assuming as underlying probabilistic model a stationary Markov Random Field. Less informative dependencies are filtered out using an auto calculated threshold, retaining most reliable connections. TimeDelay-ARACNE can infer small local networks of time regulated gene-gene interactions detecting their versus and also discovering cyclic interactions also when only a medium-small number of measurements are available. We test the algorithm both on synthetic networks and on microarray expression profiles. Microarray measurements concern S. cerevisiae cell cycle, E. coli SOS pathways and a recently developed network for in vivo assessment of reverse engineering algorithms. Our results are compared with ARACNE itself and with the ones of two previously published algorithms: Dynamic Bayesian Networks and systems of ODEs, showing that TimeDelay-ARACNE has good accuracy, recall and F-score for the network reconstruction task.
Conclusions: Here we report the adaptation of the ARACNE algorithm to infer gene regulatory networks from timecourse data, so that, the resulting network is represented as a directed graph. The proposed algorithm is expected to be useful in reconstruction of small biological directed networks from time course data.},

We discuss a probabilistic model of overlapping biological processes, gene membership in those processes, and an addition to that model that identiﬁes regulatory mechanisms controlling process activation. A key feature of our approach is that we allow genes to participate in multiple processes, thus providing a more biologically plausible model for the process of gene regulation. We present algorithms to learn each model automatically from data, using only genomewide measurements of gene expression as input. We compare our results to those obtained by other approaches and show that signiﬁcant beneﬁts can be gained by modeling both the organization of genes into overlapping cellular processes and the regulatory programs of these processes. Moreover, our method successfully grouped genes known to function together, recovered many regulatory relationships that are known in the literature, and suggested novel hypotheses regarding the regulatory role of previously uncharacterized proteins.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          The Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacytelase (NuRD) complex is a co-repressive complex involved in many pathological and physiological processes in the cell. Previous studies have identified one of its components, Mbd3, as a potent inhibitor for reprogramming of somatic cells to pluripotency. Following OSKM induction, early and partial depletion of Mbd3 protein followed by applying naïve ground-state pluripotency conditions, results in a highly efficient and near-deterministic generation of mouse iPS cells. Increasing evidence indicates that the NuRD complex assumes multiple mutually exclusive protein complexes, and it remains unclear whether the deterministic iPSC phenotype is the result of a specific NuRD sub complex. Since complete ablation of Mbd3 blocks somatic cell proliferation, here we aimed to identify alternative ways to block Mbd3-dependent NuRD activity by identifying additional functionally relevant components of the Mbd3/NuRD complex during early stages of reprogramming. We identified Gatad2a (also known as P66α), a relatively uncharacterized NuRD-specific subunit, whose complete deletion does not impact somatic cell proliferation, yet specifically disrupts Mbd3/NuRD repressive activity on the pluripotency circuit during both stem cell differentiation and reprogramming to pluripotency. Complete ablation of Gatad2a in somatic cells, but not Gatad2b, results in a deterministic naïve iPSC reprogramming where up to 100\% of donor somatic cells successfully complete the process within 8 days. Genetic and biochemical analysis established a distinct sub-complex within the NuRD complex (Gatad2a-Chd4-Mbd3) as the functional and biochemical axis blocking reestablishment of murine naïve pluripotency. Disassembly of this axis by depletion of Gatad2a, results in resistance to conditions promoting exit of naïve pluripotency and delays differentiation. We further highlight context- and posttranslational dependent modifications of the NuRD complex affecting its interactions and assembly in different cell states. Collectively, our work unveils the distinct functionality, composition and interactions of Gatad2a-Chd4-Mbd3/NuRD subcomplex during the resolution and establishment of mouse naïve pluripotency.},

            2-7
            . Despite important progress, the dynamics of epigenetic reprogramming at high resolution in correctly reprogrammed iPSCs and throughout the entire process remain largely undefined. This gap in understanding results from the inefficiency of conventional reprogramming methods coupled with the difficulty of prospectively isolating the rare cells that eventually correctly reprogram into iPSCs. Here we characterize cell fate conversion from fibroblast to iPSC using a highly efficient deterministic murine reprogramming system engineered through optimized inhibition of Gatad2a-Mbd3/NuRD repressive sub-complex. This comprehensive characterization provides single-day resolution of dynamic changes in levels of gene expression, chromatin modifications, TF binding, DNA accessibility and DNA methylation. The integrative analysis identified two transcriptional modules that dominate successful reprogramming. One consists of genes whose transcription is regulated by on/off
            e
            pigenetic
            s
            witching of modifications in their
            p
            romoters (abbreviated as ESPGs), and the second consists of genes with
            p
            romoters in a
            c
            onstitutively
            a
            ctive chromatin state, but a dynamic expression pattern (abbreviated as CAPGs). ESPGs are mainly regulated by OSK, rather than Myc, and are enriched for cell fate determinants and pluripotency factors. CAPGs are predominantly regulated by Myc, and are enriched for cell biosynthetic regulatory functions. We used the ESPG module to study the identity and temporal occurrence of activating and repressing epigenetic switching during reprogramming. Removal of repressive chromatin modifications precedes chromatin opening and binding of RNA polymerase II at enhancers and promoters, and the opposite dynamics occur during repression of enhancers and promoters. Genome wide DNA methylation analysis demonstrated that de novo DNA methylation is not required for highly efficient conducive iPSC reprogramming, and identified a group of super-enhancers targeted by OSK, whose early demethylation marks commitment to a successful reprogramming trajectory also in inefficient conventional reprogramming systems. CAPGs are distinctively regulated by multiple synergystic ways: 1) Myc activity, delivered either endogenously or exogenously, dominates CAPG expression changes and is indispensable for induction of pluripotency in somatic cells; 2) A change in tRNA codon usage which is specific to CAPGs, but not ESPGs, and favors their translation. In summary, our unbiased high-resolution mapping of epigenetic changes on somatic cells that are committed to undergo successful reprogramming reveals interleaved epigenetic and biosynthetic reconfigurations that rapidly commission and propel conducive reprogramming toward naïve pluripotency.},

Such genetic variants can be drivers or passengers of tumorigenesis and create vulnerabilities for potential therapeutic exploitation. To identify genotype-dependent vulnerabilities, forward genetic screens in different genetic backgrounds have been conducted. We devised MINGLE, a computational framework to integrate CRISPR/ Cas9 screens originating from different libraries building on approaches pioneered for genetic network discovery in model organisms. We applied this method to integrate and analyze data from 85 CRISPR/Cas9 screens in human cancer cells combining functional data with information on genetic variants to explore more than 2.1 million gene-background relationships. In addition to known dependencies, we identified new genotype-specific vulnerabilities of cancer cells. Experimental validation of predicted vulnerabilities identified GANAB and PRKCSH as new positive regulators of Wnt/b-catenin signaling. By clustering genes with similar genetic interaction profiles, we drew the largest genetic network in cancer cells to date. Our scalable approach highlights how diverse genetic screens can be integrated to systematically build informative maps of genetic interactions in cancer, which can grow dynamically as more data are included.},

	abstract = {There is substantial interest in the evolutionary forces that shaped the regulatory framework that is established in early human development. Progress in this area has been slow because it is difficult to obtain relevant biological samples. Inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide the ability to establish in vitro models of early human and non-human primate developmental stages. Using matched iPSC panels from humans and chimpanzees, we comparatively characterized gene regulatory changes through a fourday timecourse differentiation of iPSCs (day 0) into primary streak (day 1), endoderm progenitors (day 2), and definitive endoderm (day 3). As might be expected, we found that differentiation stage is the major driver of variation in gene expression levels, followed by species. We identified thousands of differentially expressed genes between humans and chimpanzees in each differentiation stage. Yet, when we considered gene-specific dynamic regulatory trajectories throughout the timecourse, we found that 75\% of genes, including nearly all known endoderm developmental markers, have similar trajectories in the two species. Interestingly, we observed a marked reduction of both intra- and inter-species variation in gene expression levels in primitive streak samples compared to the iPSCs, with a recovery of regulatory variation in endoderm progenitors. The reduction of variation in gene expression levels at a specific developmental stage, paired with overall high degree of conservation of temporal gene regulation, is consistent with the dynamics of developmental canalization. Overall, we conclude that endoderm development in iPSC-based models are highly conserved and canalized between humans and our closest evolutionary relative.},

We then compare our results with previous studies of adaptive noncoding changes, analyzing correlations at the level of gene ontology groups, in order to gain statistical power to detect correlations.
Conclusions: Consistent with previous studies, we find little correlation between gene expression and adaptive noncoding changes at the level of individual genes; however, we do find significant correlations at the level of biological function ontology groups. The types of function include processes regulated by specific transcription factors, responses to genetic or chemical perturbations, and differentiation of cell types within the immune system. Among functional categories co-enriched with both differential expression and noncoding adaptation, prominent themes include cancer, particularly epithelial cancers, and neural development and function.},

	abstract = {In vertebrates, primary sex determination refers to the decision within a bipotential organ precursor to differentiate as a testis or ovary. Bifurcation of organ fate begins between embryonic day (E) 11.0–E12.0 in mice and likely involves a dynamic transcription network that is poorly understood. To elucidate the first steps of sexual fate specification, we profiled the XX and XY gonad transcriptomes at fine granularity during this period and resolved cascades of gene activation and repression. C57BL/6J (B6) XY gonads showed a consistent ,5-hour delay in the activation of most male pathway genes and repression of female pathway genes relative to 129S1/SvImJ, which likely explains the sensitivity of the B6 strain to male-to-female sex reversal. Using this fine time course data, we predicted novel regulatory genes underlying expression QTLs (eQTLs) mapped in a previous study. To test predictions, we developed an in vitro gonad primary cell assay and optimized a lentivirus-based shRNA delivery method to silence candidate genes and quantify effects on putative targets. We provide strong evidence that Lmo4 (Lim-domain only 4) is a novel regulator of sex determination upstream of SF1 (Nr5a1), Sox9, Fgf9, and Col9a3. This approach can be readily applied to identify regulatory interactions in other systems.},

Here, we show that similar reprogramming can also be achieved through the direct activation of endogenous genes using engineered CRISPR/Cas9-based transcriptional activators. We use this approach to induce activation of the endogenous Brn2, Ascl1, and Myt1l genes (BAM factors) to convert mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts to induced neuronal cells. This direct activation of endogenous genes rapidly remodeled the epigenetic state of the target loci and induced sustained endogenous gene expression during reprogramming. Thus, transcriptional activation and epigenetic remodeling of endogenous master transcription factors are sufﬁcient for conversion between cell types. The rapid and sustained activation of endogenous genes in their native chromatin context by this approach may facilitate reprogramming with transient methods that avoid genomic integration and provides a new strategy for overcoming epigenetic barriers to cell fate speciﬁcation.},

	abstract = {Pluripotent stem cells display a unique expression pattern of microRNAs (miRNAs). These {\textasciitilde} 22 nucleotide non-coding RNAs have established a crucial role in controlling gene expression of pluripotent stem cells at the post-transcriptional level. Recent studies made important advances in identifying miRNA regulated processes like de novo DNA methylation, progression of the cell cycle and regulation of cell fate decision. miRNAs have also the ability to reprogram somatic cells to pluripotent stem cells and on the other hand, to induce differentiation of pluripotent stem cells into distinct somatic lineages. Previously it was published that miRNAs can direct reprogramming on its own. Here we provide evidence and critically discuss that the effect of miRNA depends on co-expression of the classical reprogramming factors. During transition between these different cell fates distinct miRNAs adjust the levels of speciﬁc transcriptional programs and confer robustness to differentiation processes. This results in a complex network between miRNAs and their targets. The fact that miRNAs itself can also be regulated by its targets establishes complex regulatory loops. Based on bioinformatical predictions, each miRNA theoretically has hundreds of target genes making it even more challenging to understand the complete network between miRNAs and their targets.},

	abstract = {The role of enhancers, a key class of non-coding regulatory DNA elements, in cancer development has increasingly been appreciated. Here, we present the detection and characterization of a large number of expressed enhancers in a genome-wide analysis of 8928 tumor samples across 33 cancer types using TCGA RNA-seq data. Compared with matched normal tissues, global enhancer activation was observed in most cancers. Across cancer types, global enhancer activity was positively associated with aneuploidy, but not mutation load, suggesting a hypothesis centered on ‘‘chromatin-state’’ to explain their interplay. Integrating eQTL, mRNA coexpression, and Hi-C data analysis, we developed a computational method to infer causal enhancergene interactions, revealing enhancers of clinically actionable genes. Having identiﬁed an enhancer \$140 kb downstream of PD-L1, a major immunotherapy target, we validated it experimentally. This study provides a systematic view of enhancer activity in diverse tumor contexts and suggests the clinical implications of enhancers.},

	abstract = {Genomics has provided a detailed structural description of the cancer genome. Identifying oncogenic drivers that work primarily through dosage changes is a current challenge. Unrestrained proliferation is a critical hallmark of cancer. We constructed modular, barcoded libraries of human open reading frames (ORFs) and performed screens for proliferation regulators in multiple cell types. Approximately 10\% of genes regulate proliferation, with most performing in an unexpectedly highly tissue-speciﬁc manner. Proliferation drivers in a given cell type showed speciﬁc enrichment in somatic copy number changes (SCNAs) from cognate tumors and helped predict aneuploidy patterns in those tumors, implying that tissue-type-speciﬁc genetic network architectures underlie SCNA and driver selection in different cancers. In vivo screening conﬁrmed these results. We report a substantial contribution to the catalog of SCNA-associated cancer drivers, identifying 147 ampliﬁed and 107 deleted genes as potential drivers, and derive insights about the genetic network architecture of aneuploidy in tumors.},

	abstract = {As organisms age, cells accumulate genetic and epigenetic errors that eventually lead to impaired organ function or catastrophic transformation such as cancer. Because aging reﬂects a stochastic process of increasing disorder, cells in an organ will be individually affected in different ways, thus rendering bulk analyses of postmitotic adult cells difﬁcult to interpret. Here, we directly measure the effects of aging in human tissue by performing single-cell transcriptome analysis of 2,544 human pancreas cells from eight donors spanning six decades of life. We ﬁnd that islet endocrine cells from older donors display increased levels of transcriptional noise and potential fate drift. By determining the mutational history of individual cells, we uncover a novel mutational signature in healthy aging endocrine cells. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from primary cells to derive insights into genetic and transcriptional processes that operate on aging human tissue.},

An emerging concept is that lncRNAs serve as protein scaffolds, forming ribonucleoproteins and bringing proteins in proximity. However, only few scaffolding lncRNAs have been characterized and the prevalence of this function is unknown. Here, we propose the ﬁrst computational approach aimed at predicting scaffolding lncRNAs at large scale. We predicted the largest human lncRNA–protein interaction network to date using the catRAPID omics algorithm. In combination with tissue expression and statistical approaches, we identiﬁed 847 lncRNAs (∼5\% of the long noncoding transcriptome) predicted to scaffold half of the known protein complexes and network modules. Lastly, we show that the association of certain lncRNAs to disease may involve their scaffolding ability. Overall, our results suggest for the ﬁrst time that RNA-mediated scaffolding of protein complexes and modules may be a common mechanism in human cells.},

The combined loss of all miRNAs results in embryonic lethality in all animals analyzed, illustrating the crucial role that miRNAs play collectively. However, although the loss of some individual miRNAs also results in severe developmental defects, the roles of many other miRNAs have been challenging to uncover. This has been mostly attributed to their proposed function as tuners of gene expression or providers of robustness. Here, we present a view of miRNAs in the context of development as a hierarchical and canalized series of gene regulatory networks. In this scheme, only a fraction of embryonic miRNAs act at the top of this hierarchy, with their loss resulting in broad developmental defects, whereas most other miRNAs are expressed with high cellular specificity and play roles at the periphery of development, affecting the terminal features of specialized cells. This view could help to shed new light on our understanding of miRNA function in development, disease and evolution.},

Here, we show how latent variable models with nonlinear dependencies can be applied to capture beyond-pairwise constraints in biomolecules. We present a new probabilistic model for sequence families, DeepSequence, that can predict the effects of mutations across a variety of deep mutational scanning experiments significantly better than site independent or pairwise models that are based on the same evolutionary data. The model, learned in an unsupervised manner solely from sequence information, is grounded with biologically motivated priors, reveals latent organization of sequence families, and can be used to extrapolate to new parts of sequence space.},

Here, we make use of a framework that treats intracellular signal transduction networks as ‘‘black boxes’’ with characterized input-to-output response relationships. We study simple cell-to-cell communication circuit motifs and ﬁnd conditions that generate bimodal responses in time, as well as mechanisms for independently controlling synchronization and delay of cell-population responses.

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
          
            The introduction of novel CTCF binding sites in gene regulatory regions in the rodent lineage is partly the effect of transposable element expansion. The exact mechanism and functional impact of evolutionarily novel CTCF binding sites are not yet fully understood. We investigated the impact of novel species-specific CTCF binding sites in two
            Mus
            genus subspecies,
            Mus musculus domesticus
            and
            Mus musculus castaneus,
            that diverged 0.5 million years ago. The activity of the B2-B4 family of transposable elements independently in both lineages leads to the proliferation of novel CTCF binding sites. A subset of evolutionarily young sites may harbour transcriptional functionality, as evidenced by the stability of their binding across multiple tissues in
            M. musculus domesticus
            (BL6), while overall the distance of species-specific CTCF binding to the nearest transcription start sites and/or topologically-associated domains (TADs) is largely similar to
            musculus
            -common CTCF sites. Remarkably, we discovered a recurrent regulatory architecture consisting of a CTCF binding site and an interferon gene that appears to have been tandemly duplicated to create a 15-gene cluster on chromosome 4, thus forming a novel BL6 specific immune locus, in which CTCF may play a regulatory role. Our results demonstrate that thousands of CTCF binding sites show multiple functional signatures rapidly after incorporation into the genome.},

Signaling networks reprogrammed by protein overexpression remain largely uncharacterized, hindering discovery of paths to therapeutic intervention. We previously developed a single cell proteomics approach based on mass cytometry that enables quantitative assessment of overexpression effects on the signaling network. Here we applied this approach in a human kinome- and phosphatome-wide study to assess how 649 individually overexpressed proteins modulate the cancer-related signaling network in HEK293T cells. Based on these data we expanded the functional classification of human kinases and phosphatases and detected 208 novel signaling relationships. In the signaling dynamics analysis, we showed that increased ERK-specific phosphatases sustained proliferative signaling, and using a novel combinatorial overexpression approach, we confirmed this phosphatase-driven mechanism of cancer progression. Finally, we identified 54 proteins that caused ligand-independent ERK activation with potential as biomarkers for drug resistance in cells carrying BRAF mutations.},

	abstract = {Background: The combinatorial binding of trans-acting factors (TFs) to the DNA is critical to the spatial and temporal specificity of gene regulation. For certain regulatory regions, more than one regulatory module (set of TFs that bind together) are combined to achieve context-specific gene regulation. However, previous approaches are limited to either pairwise TF co-association analysis or assuming that only one module is used in each regulatory region.
Results: We present a new computational approach that models the modular organization of TF combinatorial binding. Our method learns compact and coherent regulatory modules from in vivo binding data using a topic model. We found that the binding of 115 TFs in K562 cells can be organized into 49 interpretable modules. Furthermore, we found that tens of thousands of regulatory regions use multiple modules, a structure that cannot be observed with previous hard clustering based methods. The modules discovered recapitulate many published protein-protein physical interactions, have consistent functional annotations of chromatin states, and uncover context specific co-binding such as gene proximal binding of NFY + FOS + SP and distal binding of NFY + FOS + USF. For certain TFs, the co-binding partners of direct binding (motif present) differs from those of indirect binding (motif absent); the distinct set of co-binding partners can predict whether the TF binds directly or indirectly with up to 95\% accuracy. Joint analysis across two cell types reveals both cell-type-specific and shared regulatory modules.
Conclusions: Our results provide comprehensive cell-type-specific combinatorial binding maps and suggest a modular organization of combinatorial binding.},

	abstract = {The modular architecture of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks is evident in diverse species with a wide range of complexity. However, the molecular components that lead to the evolution of modularity in PPI networks have not been clearly identified. Here, we show that weak domain-linear motif interactions (DLIs) are more likely to connect different biological modules than strong domain-domain interactions (DDIs). This molecular division of labor is essential for the evolution of modularity in the complex PPI networks of diverse eukaryotic species. In particular, DLIs may compensate for the reduction in module boundaries that originate from increased connections between different modules in complex PPI networks. In addition, we show that the identification of biological modules can be greatly improved by including molecular characteristics of protein interactions. Our findings suggest that transient interactions have played a unique role in shaping the architecture and modularity of biological networks over the course of evolution.},

Here, we introduced genome-wide pooled CRISPR-Cas9 libraries into dendritic cells (DCs) to identify genes that control the induction of tumor necrosis factor (Tnf) by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a key process in the host response to pathogens, mediated by the Tlr4 pathway. We found many of the known regulators of Tlr4 signaling, as well as dozens of previously unknown candidates that we validated. By measuring protein markers and mRNA proﬁles in DCs that are deﬁcient in known or candidate genes, we classiﬁed the genes into three functional modules with distinct effects on the canonical responses to LPS and highlighted functions for the PAF complex and oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex. Our ﬁndings uncover new facets of innate immune circuits in primary cells and provide a genetic approach for dissection of mammalian cell circuits.},

	abstract = {The application of RNA interference (RNAi) to mammalian cells has provided the means to perform phenotypic screens to determine the functions of genes. Although RNAi has revolutionized loss-of-function genetic experiments, it has been difficult to systematically assess the prevalence and consequences of off-target effects. The Connectivity Map (CMAP) represents an unprecedented resource to study the gene expression consequences of expressing short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs). Analysis of signatures for over 13,000 shRNAs applied in 9 cell lines revealed that microRNA (miRNA)-like off-target effects of RNAi are far stronger and more pervasive than generally appreciated. We show that mitigating off-target effects is feasible in these datasets via computational methodologies to produce a consensus gene signature (CGS). In addition, we compared RNAi technology to clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-based knockout by analysis of 373 single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) in 6 cells lines and show that the on-target efficacies are comparable, but CRISPR technology is far less susceptible to systematic off-target effects. These results will help guide the proper use and analysis of loss-of-function reagents for the determination of gene function.},

We uncover eight broad cell classes in Nematostella, including neurons, cnidocytes, and digestive cells. Each class comprises different subtypes deﬁned by the expression of multiple speciﬁc markers. In particular, we characterize a surprisingly diverse repertoire of neurons, which comparative analysis suggests are the result of lineage-speciﬁc diversiﬁcation.

Our data reveal markedly different cell-type- and hematopoietic-lineage-speciﬁc chromatin modiﬁcation patterns. Differential analysis between younger and older adults shows that aging is associated with increased heterogeneity between individuals and elevated cell-to-cell variability in chromatin modiﬁcations. Analysis of a twin cohort unveils heritability of chromatin modiﬁcations and demonstrates that aging-related chromatin alterations are predominantly driven by non-heritable inﬂuences. Together, we present a powerful platform for chromatin and immunology research. Our discoveries highlight the profound impacts of aging on chromatin modiﬁcations.},

However, once a commitment is made, noise becomes detrimental to reliable function, and the mechanisms enabling post-commitment noise suppression are unclear. Here, we ﬁnd that architectural constraints on noise suppression are overcome to stabilize fate commitment. Using single-molecule and time-lapse imaging, we ﬁnd that—after a noise-driven event—human immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV) strongly attenuates expression noise through a non-transcriptional negative-feedback circuit. Feedback is established through a serial cascade of post-transcriptional splicing, whereby proteins generated from spliced mRNAs autodeplete their own precursor unspliced mRNAs. Strikingly, this auto-depletion circuitry minimizes noise to stabilize HIV’s commitment decision, and a noisesuppression molecule promotes stabilization. This feedback mechanism for noise suppression suggests a functional role for delayed splicing in other systems and may represent a generalizable architecture of diverse homeostatic signaling circuits.},

Notably, many protein complexes are modulated in speciﬁc cell-cycle phases, reﬂecting their roles in processes such as DNA replication, chromatin remodeling, transcription, translation, and disintegration of the nuclear envelope. Surprisingly, only small differences in the interaction states were seen between the G1 and the G2 phase, suggesting similar hardwiring of biochemical processes in these two phases.

Systematic survey of genetic interactions in yeast showed that genes operating in the same biological process have highly correlated genetic interaction profiles, and this observation has been exploited to infer gene function in model organisms. Systematic surveys of digenic perturbations in human cells are also highly informative, but are not scalable, even with CRISPR-mediated methods. As an alternative, we developed an indirect method of deriving functional interactions. We show that genes having correlated knockout fitness profiles across diverse, non-isogenic cell lines are analogous to genes having correlated genetic interaction profiles across isogenic query strains, and similarly implies shared biological function. We constructed a network of genes with correlated fitness profiles across 400 CRISPR knockout screens in cancer cell lines into a “coessentiality network,” with up to 500-fold enrichment for co-functional gene pairs, enabling strong inference of human gene function. Modules in the network are connected in a layered web that gives insight into the hierarchical organization of the cell.},

	abstract = {Protein complexes are assemblies of subunits that have co-evolved to execute one or many coordinated functions in the cellular environment. Functional annotation of mammalian protein complexes is critical to understanding biological processes, as well as disease mechanisms. Here, we used genetic coessentiality derived from genome-scale RNAi- and CRISPR-Cas9-based ﬁtness screens performed across hundreds of human cancer cell lines to assign measures of functional similarity. From these measures, we systematically built and characterized functional similarity networks that recapitulate known structural and functional features of well-studied protein complexes and resolve novel functional modules within complexes lacking structural resolution, such as the mammalian SWI/SNF complex. Finally, by integrating functional networks with large protein-protein interaction networks, we discovered novel protein complexes involving recently evolved genes of unknown function. Taken together, these ﬁndings demonstrate the utility of genetic perturbation screens alone, and in combination with large-scale biophysical data, to enhance our understanding of mammalian protein complexes in normal and disease states.},

	abstract = {Prediction of transcription factor (TF) activities from the gene expression of their targets (i.e. TF regulon) is becoming a widely-used approach to characterize the functional status of transcriptional regulatory circuits. Several strategies and datasets have been proposed to link the target genes likely regulated by a TF, each one providing a different level of evidence. The most established ones are: (i) manually curated repositories, (ii) interactions derived from ChIP-seq binding data, (iii) in silico prediction of TF binding on gene promoters, and (iv) reverse-engineered regulons from large gene expression datasets. However, it is not known how these different sources of regulons affect the TF activity estimations, and thereby downstream analysis and interpretation. Here we compared the accuracy and biases of these strategies to define human TF regulons by means of their ability to predict changes in TF activities in three reference benchmark datasets. We assembled a collection of TF-target interactions among 1,541 TFs, and evaluated how the different molecular and regulatory properties of the TFs, such as the DNA-binding domain, specificities or mode of interaction with the chromatin, affect the predictions of TF activity changes. We assessed their coverage and found little overlap on the regulons derived from each strategy and better performance by literature-curated information followed by ChIP-seq data. We provide an integrated resource of all TF-target interactions derived through these strategies with a confidence score, as a resource for enhanced prediction of TF activities.},

	abstract = {Background: Molecular interaction data at proteomic and genetic levels provide physical and functional insights into a molecular biosystem and are helpful for the construction of pathway structures complementarily. Despite advances in inferring biological pathways using genetic interaction data, there still exists weakness in developed models, such as, activity pathway networks (APN), when integrating the data from proteomic and genetic levels. It is necessary to develop new methods to infer pathway structure by both of interaction data.
Results: We utilized probabilistic graphical model to develop a new method that integrates genetic interaction and protein interaction data and infers exquisitely detailed pathway structure. We modeled the pathway network as Bayesian network and applied this model to infer pathways for the coherent subsets of the global genetic interaction profiles, and the available data set of endoplasmic reticulum genes. The protein interaction data were derived from the BioGRID database. Our method can accurately reconstruct known cellular pathway structures, including SWR complex, ER-Associated Degradation (ERAD) pathway, N-Glycan biosynthesis pathway, Elongator complex, Retromer complex, and Urmylation pathway. By comparing N-Glycan biosynthesis pathway and Urmylation pathway identified from our approach with that from APN, we found that our method is able to overcome its weakness (certain edges are inexplicable). According to underlying protein interaction network, we defined a simple scoring function that only adopts genetic interaction information to avoid the balance difficulty in the APN. Using the effective stochastic simulation algorithm, the performance of our proposed method is significantly high.
Conclusion: We developed a new method based on Bayesian network to infer detailed pathway structures from interaction data at proteomic and genetic levels. The results indicate that the developed method performs better in predicting signaling pathways than previously described models.},

The unique signaling states correlated with differential gene expression and non-additive transcription patterns. We further elucidated how a signal-rich environment can fine-tune the signaling network and adjust physiological outcomes, by kinase and phosphatase activity profiling. We describe how complex extracellular conditions affect phospho-turnover and the basal phosphorylation status.

	abstract = {Interactions mediated by cell surface receptors initiate important instructive signaling cues but can be difficult to detect in biochemical assays because they are often highly transient and membrane-embedded receptors are difficult to solubilize in their native conformation. Here, we address these biochemical challenges by using a genome-scale cell-based genetic screening approach using CRISPR gene knockout technology to identify cellular pathways required for specific cell surface recognition events. Using high-affinity monoclonal antibodies and lowaffinity ligands, we determined the necessary screening parameters including the importance of establishing binding contributions from the glycocalyx that permitted the unequivocal identification of genes encoding directly interacting membrane-embedded receptors with high statistical confidence. Importantly, we show that this genome-wide screening approach additionally identified receptor-specific pathways that are required for functional display of receptors on the cell surface which included chaperones, enzymes that add posttranslational modifications, trafficking proteins, and transcription factors. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the approach by identifying IGF2R (cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor) as a binding partner for the R2 subunit of GABAB receptors. We show that this interaction is direct and is critically dependent on mannose-6-phosphate, providing a mechanism for the internalization and regulation of GABAB receptor signaling. We conclude that this single approach can reveal both the molecular nature and the genetic pathways required for functional cell surface display of receptors recognized by antibodies, secreted proteins and membraneembedded ligands without the need to make any prior assumptions regarding their biochemical properties.},

            K562 is widely used in biomedical research. It is one of three tier-one cell lines of ENCODE and also most commonly used for large-scale CRISPR/Cas9 screens. Although its functional genomic and epigenomic characteristics have been extensively studied, its genome sequence and genomic structural features have never been comprehensively analyzed. Such information is essential for the correct interpretation and understanding of the vast troves of existing functional genomics and epigenomics data for K562. We performed and integrated deep-coverage whole-genome (short-insert), mate-pair, and linked-read sequencing as well as karyotyping and array CGH analysis to identify a wide spectrum of genome characteristics in K562: copy numbers (CN) of aneuploid chromosome segments at high-resolution, SNVs and Indels (both corrected for CN in aneuploid regions), loss of heterozygosity, mega-base-scale phased haplotypes often spanning entire chromosome arms, structural variants (SVs) including small and large-scale complex SVs and non-reference retrotransposon insertions. Many SVs were phased, assembled, and experimentally validated. We identified multiple allele-specific deletions and duplications within the tumor suppressor gene
            FHIT
            . Taking aneuploidy into account, we re-analyzed K562 RNA-seq and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data for allele-specific expression and allele-specific DNA methylation. We also show examples of how deeper insights into regulatory complexity are gained by integrating genomic variant information and structural context with functional genomics and epigenomics data. Furthermore, using K562 haplotype information, we produced an allele-specific CRISPR targeting map. This comprehensive whole-genome analysis serves as a resource for future studies that utilize K562 as well as a framework for the analysis of other cancer genomes.},

Efforts in human cells using focused gene sets underscore the utility of this approach, but the feasibility of generating largescale, diverse human GI maps remains unresolved. We developed a CRISPR interference platform for large-scale quantitative mapping of human GIs. We systematically perturbed 222,784 gene pairs in two cancer cell lines. The resultant maps cluster functionally related genes, assigning function to poorly characterized genes, including TMEM261, a new electron transport chain component. Individual GIs pinpoint unexpected relationships between pathways, exempliﬁed by a speciﬁc cholesterol biosynthesis intermediate whose accumulation induces deoxynucleotide depletion, causing replicative DNA damage and a synthetic-lethal interaction with the ATR/9-1-1 DNA repair pathway. Our map provides a broad resource, establishes GI maps as a high-resolution tool for dissecting gene function, and serves as a blueprint for mapping the genetic landscape of human cells.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing occurs in the context of chromatin, which is heterogeneous in structure and function across the genome. Chromatin heterogeneity is thought to affect genome editing efficiency, but this has been challenging to quantify due to the presence of confounding variables. Here, we develop a method that exploits the allele-specific chromatin status of imprinted genes in order to address this problem. Because maternal and paternal alleles of imprinted genes have identical DNA sequence and are situated in the same nucleus, allele-specific differences in the frequency and spectrum of Cas9-induced mutations can be attributed unequivocally to epigenetic mechanisms. We found that heterochromatin can impede mutagenesis, but to a degree that depends on other key experimental parameters. Mutagenesis was impeded by up to 7-fold when Cas9 exposure was brief and when intracellular Cas9 expression was low. Surprisingly, the outcome of mutagenic DNA repair was independent of chromatin state, with similar efficiencies of homology directed repair and deletion spectra on maternal and paternal chromosomes. Combined, our data show that heterochromatin imposes a permeable barrier that influences the kinetics, but not the endpoint of CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, and suggest that therapeutic applications involving low-level Cas9 exposure will be particularly affected by chromatin status.},

	abstract = {Evolution repeatedly converges on only a few regulatory circuit designs that achieve a given function. This simplicity helps us understand biological networks. However, why so few circuits are rediscovered by evolution is unclear. We address this question for the case of fold-change detection (FCD): a response to relative changes of input rather than absolute changes. Two types of FCD circuits recur in biological systems—the incoherent feedforward and non-linear integral-feedback loops. We performed an analytical screen of all three-node circuits in a class comprising \$500,000 topologies. We ﬁnd that FCD is rare, but still there are hundreds of FCD topologies. The two experimentally observed circuits are among the very few minimal circuits that optimally trade off speed, noise resistance, and response amplitude. This suggests a way to understand why evolution converges on only few topologies for a given function and provides FCD designs for synthetic construction and future discovery.},

Here, we introduce Single-cell Variational Inference (scVI), a scalable framework for probabilistic representation and analysis of gene expression in single cells. Our model uses variational inference and stochastic optimization of deep neural networks to approximate the parameters that govern the distribution of expression values of each gene in every cell, using a non-linear mapping between the observations and a low-dimensional latent space.},

	abstract = {Hyperspectral imaging can be used for object detection and for discriminating between diﬀerent objects based on their spectral characteristics. One of the main problems of hyperspectral data analysis is the presence of mixed pixels, due to the low spatial resolution of such images. This means that several spectrally pure signatures (endmembers) are combined into the same mixed pixel. Linear spectral unmixing follows an unsupervised approach which aims at inferring pure spectral signatures and their material fractions at each pixel of the scene. The huge data volumes acquired by such sensors put stringent requirements on processing and unmixing methods. This paper proposes an eﬃcient implementation of a unsupervised linear unmixing method on GPUs using CUDA. The method ﬁnds the smallest simplex by solving a sequence of nonsmooth convex subproblems using variable splitting to obtain a constraint formulation, and then applying an augmented Lagrangian technique. The parallel implementation of SISAL presented in this work exploits the GPU architecture at low level, using shared memory and coalesced accesses to memory. The results herein presented indicate that the GPU implementation can signiﬁcantly accelerate the method’s execution over big datasets while maintaining the methods accuracy.},

Pooling of genetic perturbations greatly increases screening throughput, but has so far been limited to screens of enrichments defined by cell fitness and flow cytometry, or to comparatively low-throughput single cell gene expression profiles. Although microscopy is a rich source of spatial and temporal information about mammalian cells, high-content imaging screens have been restricted to much less efficient arrayed formats. Here, we introduce an optical method to link perturbations and their phenotypic outcomes at the singlecell level in a pooled setting. Barcoded perturbations are read out by targeted
            in situ
            sequencing following image-based phenotyping. We apply this technology to screen a focused set of 952 genes across {\textgreater}3 million cells for involvement in NF-κB activation by imaging the translocation of RelA (p65) to the nucleus, recovering 20 known pathway components and 3 novel candidate positive regulators of IL-1β and TNFα-stimulated immune responses.},

Targeted activation of the endogenous Myod1 gene locus with this system led to stable and sustained reprogramming of mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts into skeletal myocytes. The levels of myogenic marker expression obtained by the activation of endogenous Myod1 gene were comparable to that achieved by overexpression of lentivirally delivered MYOD1 transcription factor.},

	abstract = {The mutation patterns at Cas9 targeted sites contain unique information regarding the nuclease activity and repair mechanisms in mammalian cells. However, analytical framework for extracting such information are lacking. Here, we present a novel computational platform called Rational InDel MetaAnalysis (RIMA) that enables an in-depth comprehensive analysis of Cas9-induced genetic alterations, especially InDels mutations. RIMA can be used to quantitate the contribution of classical microhomologymediated end joining (c-MMEJ) pathway in the formation of mutations at Cas9 target sites. We used RIMA to compare mutational signatures at 15 independent Cas9 target sites in human A549 wildtype and A549POLQ knockout cells to elucidate the role of DNA polymerase ␪ in c-MMEJ. Moreover, the single nucleotide insertions at the Cas9 target sites represent duplications of preceding nucleotides, suggesting that the ﬂexibility of the Cas9 nuclease domains results in both blunt- and staggered-end cuts. Thymine at the fourth nucleotide before protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) results in a two-fold higher occurrence of single nucleotide InDels compared to guanine at the same position. This study provides a novel approach for the characterization of the Cas9 nucleases with improved accuracy in predicting genome editing outcomes and a potential strategy for homologyindependent targeted genomic integration.},

	abstract = {Background: Reconstruction of executable mechanistic models from single-cell gene expression data represents a powerful approach to understanding developmental and disease processes. New ambitious efforts like the Human Cell Atlas will soon lead to an explosion of data with potential for uncovering and understanding the regulatory networks which underlie the behaviour of all human cells. In order to take advantage of this data, however, there is a need for general-purpose, user-friendly and efficient computational tools that can be readily used by biologists who do not have specialist computer science knowledge.
Results: The Single Cell Network Synthesis toolkit (SCNS) is a general-purpose computational tool for the reconstruction and analysis of executable models from single-cell gene expression data. Through a graphical user interface, SCNS takes single-cell qPCR or RNA-sequencing data taken across a time course, and searches for logical rules that drive transitions from early cell states towards late cell states. Because the resulting reconstructed models are executable, they can be used to make predictions about the effect of specific gene perturbations on the generation of specific lineages.
Conclusions: SCNS should be of broad interest to the growing number of researchers working in single-cell genomics and will help further facilitate the generation of valuable mechanistic insights into developmental, homeostatic and disease processes.},

	abstract = {The exact DNA mutation produced by cellular repair of a CRISPR/Cas9-generated double strand break determines its phenotypic effect. It is known that the mutational outcomes are not random, and depend on DNA sequence at the targeted location. Here, we present a systematic study of this link. We created a high throughput assay to directly measure the edits generated by over 40,000 guide RNAs, and applied it in a range of genetic backgrounds and for alternative CRISPR/Cas9 reagents. In total, we gathered data for over 1,000,000,000 mutational outcomes in synthetic constructs, which mirror those at endogenous loci. The majority of reproducible mutations are insertions of a single base, short deletions, or long microhomology-mediated deletions. gRNAs have a cell-line dependent preference for particular outcomes, especially favouring single base insertions and microhomology-mediated deletions. We uncover sequence determinants of the produced mutations at individual loci, and use these to derive a predictor of Cas9 editing outcomes with accuracy close to the theoretical maximum. This improved understanding of sequence repair allows better design of editing experiments, and may lead to future therapeutic applications.},

	abstract = {An analytical model based on the statistical properties of Open Reading Frames (ORFs) of eubacterial genomes such as codon composition and sequence length of all reading frames was developed. This new model predicts the average length, maximum length as well as the length distribution of the ORFs of 70 species with GC contents varying between 21\% and 74\%. Furthermore, the number of annotated genes is predicted with high accordance. However, the ORF length distribution in the five alternative reading frames shows interesting deviations from the predicted distribution. In particular, long ORFs appear more often than expected statistically. The unexpected depletion of stop codons in these alternative open reading frames cannot completely be explained by a biased codon usage in the +1 frame. While it is unknown if the stop codon depletion has a biological function, it could be due to a protein coding capacity of alternative ORFs exerting a selection pressure which prevents the fixation of stop codon mutations. The comparison of the analytical model with bacterial genomes, therefore, leads to a hypothesis suggesting novel gene candidates which can now be investigated in subsequent wet lab experiments.},

Scribe employs Restricted Directed Information to determine causality by estimating the strength of information transferred from a potential regulator to its downstream target. We apply Scribe and other leading approaches for causal network reconstruction to 20 several types of single­cell measurements and show that there is a dramatic drop in performance for "pseudotime” ordered single­cell data compared to true time series data. We demonstrate that performing causal inference requires temporal coupling between measurements. We show that methods such as “RNA velocity” restore some degree of coupling through an analysis of chromaffin cell fate commitment. These analyses therefore highlight an 25 important shortcoming in experimental and computational methods for analyzing gene regulation at single­cell resolution and point the way towards overcoming it.},

	abstract = {Recent advances have led to an appreciation of the vast molecular diversity of cancer. Detailed data has enabled powerful methods to sort tumors into groups with benefits for prognosis and treatment. We are still missing, however, a general theoretical framework to understand the diversity of tumor gene-expression and mutations. To address this, we present a framework based on multi-task evolution theory, using the fact that tumors evolve in the body, and that tumors are faced with multiple tasks that contribute to their fitness. In accordance with the theory, we find that tradeoff between tasks constrains tumor gene-expression to a continuum bounded by a polyhedron. The vertices of the polyhedron are gene-expression profiles each specializing in one task, allowing the tasks to be identified. We find five universal cancer tasks across tissue-types: cell-division, biomass \& energy, lipogenesis, immune-interaction and invasion \& tissue remodeling. Tumors whose gene-expression lies close to a vertex are task specialists. We find evidence that such specialists are more sensitive to drugs that interfere with this task. We find that driver mutations, but not passenger mutations, tune gene-expression towards specialization in specific tasks. This approach can integrate additional types of molecular data into a theoreticallybased framework for understanding tumor diversity.},

We developed a light-sheet microscope that adapts itself to the dramatic changes in size, shape, and optical properties of the postimplantation mouse embryo and captures its development from gastrulation to early organogenesis at the cellular level. We furthermore developed a computational framework for reconstructing longterm cell tracks, cell divisions, dynamic fate maps, and maps of tissue morphogenesis across the entire embryo.

Here, we extracted a large panel of landmark genes characterized by transcriptomics of laser capture microdissected villus segments and utilized it for single-cell spatial reconstruction, uncovering broad zonation of enterocyte function along the villus. We found that enterocytes at villus bottoms express an anti-bacterial gene program in a microbiomedependent manner. They next shift to sequential expression of carbohydrates, peptides, and fat absorption machineries in distinct villus compartments. Finally, they induce a Cd73 immune-modulatory program at the villus tips. Our approach can be used to uncover zonation patterns in other organs when prior knowledge of landmark genes is lacking.},

We apply Palantir to human bone marrow scRNA-seq data and detect key landmarks of hematopoietic differentiation.

We show that such feedback circuits are inherently unstable to mutants that misread the signal level: Mutants have a growth advantage to take over the tissue, and cannot be eliminated by known cell-intrinsic mechanisms. To resolve this, we propose that tissues have biphasic responses in which the signal is toxic at both high and low levels, such as glucotoxicity of beta cells, excitotoxicity in neurons, and toxicity of growth factors to T cells. This gives most of these mutants a frequency-dependent selective disadvantage, which leads to their elimination. However, the biphasic mechanisms create a new unstable fixed point in the feedback circuit beyond which runaway processes can occur, leading to risk of diseases such as diabetes and neurodegenerative disease. Hence, glucotoxicity, which is a dangerous cause of diabetes, may have a protective antimutant effect. Biphasic responses in tissues may provide an evolutionary stable strategy that avoids invasion by commonly occurring mutants, but at the same time cause vulnerability to disease.},

While Smart-seq2 detected the most genes per cell and across cells, CEL-seq2, Drop-seq, MARS-seq, and SCRB-seq quantiﬁed mRNA levels with less ampliﬁcation noise due to the use of unique molecular identiﬁers (UMIs). Power simulations at different sequencing depths showed that Drop-seq is more cost-efﬁcient for transcriptome quantiﬁcation of large numbers of cells, while MARS-seq, SCRB-seq, and Smart-seq2 are more efﬁcient when analyzing fewer cells. Our quantitative comparison offers the basis for an informed choice among six prominent scRNA-seq methods, and it provides a framework for benchmarking further improvements of scRNA-seq protocols.},

	abstract = {Massively multiplexed sequencing of RNA in individual cells is transforming basic and clinical life sciences. However, in standard experiments, tissues must ﬁrst be dissociated. Thus, after sequencing, information about the spatial relationships between cells is lost although this knowledge is crucial for understanding cellular and tissue-level function. Recent attempts to overcome this fundamental challenge rely on employing additional in situ gene expression imaging data which can guide spatial mapping of sequenced cells. Here we present a conceptually different approach that allows to reconstruct spatial positions of cells in a variety of tissues without using reference imaging data. We ﬁrst show for several complex biological systems that distances of single cells in expression space monotonically increase with their physical distances across tissues. We therefore seek to map cells to tissue space such that this principle is optimally preserved, while matching existing imaging data when available. We show that this optimization problem can be cast as a generalized optimal transport problem and solved efﬁciently. We apply our approach successfully to reconstruct the mammalian liver and intestinal epithelium as well as ﬂy and zebraﬁsh embryos. Our results demonstrate a simple spatial expression organization principle and that this principle (or future reﬁned principles) can be used to infer, for individual cells, meaningful spatial position probabilities from the sequencing data alone.},

	url = {http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/458786},
	abstract = {Background: In high-throughput studies, hundreds to millions of hypotheses are typically tested. Statistical methods that control the false discovery rate (FDR) have emerged as popular and powerful tools for error rate control. While classic FDR methods use only p-values as input, more modern FDR methods have been shown to increase power by incorporating complementary information as “informative covariates” to prioritize, weight, and group hypotheses. However, there is currently no consensus on how the modern methods compare to one another. We investigated the accuracy, applicability, and ease of use of two classic and six modern FDR-controlling methods by performing a systematic benchmark comparison using simulation studies as well as six case studies in computational biology.
Results: Methods that incorporate informative covariates were modestly more powerful than classic approaches, and did not underperform classic approaches, even when the covariate was completely uninformative. The majority of methods were successful at controlling the FDR, with the exception of two modern methods under certain settings. Furthermore, we found the improvement of the modern FDR methods over the classic methods increased with the informativeness of the covariate, total number of hypothesis tests, and proportion of truly non-null hypotheses.
Conclusions: Modern FDR methods that use an informative covariate provide advantages over classic FDR-controlling procedures, with the relative gain dependent on the application and informativeness of available covariates. We present our ﬁndings as a practical guide and provide recommendations to aid researchers in their choice of methods to correct for false discoveries.},

	abstract = {Accurate prediction of response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) and simultaneous development of new efficacious ICB strategy are unmet needs for cancer immunotherapy1-5. Despite the advance of existing clinical or computational biomarkers6-10, it is very limited in explicating phenotypic variability of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T lymphocytes (TILs) at the single-cell level, including tumor-specificity11,12 and distinct exhaustion profiles13-16, that are crucial for the responsiveness to ICB. Here we show that a quantitative criterion, D value, for evaluating tumor-specific TIL exhaustion, identified by our new high-dimensional single-cellbased computational method, called HD-scMed, accurately predicts response to the ICB, i.e., aPD-1, aCTLA-4, and aPD-1+aCTLA-4, with the performance of AUC=100\% in human tumors. D-value is the Euclidean distance from a subset of exhausted CD8+ TILs, identified as Pareto Front (PF)18-21 by HD-scMed within the high-dimensional expression space of a variety of exhaustion markers, to the baseline TILs excluded by the PF. We phenotypically distinguished two types of TIL “exhaustion” by the D value, namely “D Extremely-high” in non-responders, associating with high tumor-specificity imprinted with enhanced exhaustion and inactivated effector and cytotoxic signatures; and “D low” specific to responders, alternatively enriched with T cell activation and cytolytic effector T cell signatures. We also observed a large portion of “D negative” bystander T cells irrelevant to response. Notably, Dlow TILs in clinical responders display very low LAG3 expression. To reverse the functionality of the LAG3-high TILs after receiving aPD-1+aCTLA-4, we combined aLAG3 with aPD-1+aCTLA-4 in treating a murine tumor model. Remarkably, aLAG3+aPD1+aCTLA-4 displays extraordinary antitumor efficacy to eradicate advanced tumors, which is associated with burst GZMBhi TIL populations; whereas aPD-1+aCTLA-4 or aPD1+aCTLA-4 plus other ICBs as control only induce moderate tumor growth inhibition. Our study has important implications for cancer immunotherapy as providing both accurate predictions of ICB response and alternative strategy to reverse ICB resistance.},

We apply Cicero to investigate how dynamically accessible elements orchestrate gene regulation in differentiating myoblasts. Groups of Cicero-linked regulatory elements meet criteria of ‘‘chromatin hubs’’—they are enriched for physical proximity, interact with a common set of transcription factors, and undergo coordinated changes in histone marks that are predictive of changes in gene expression. Pseudotemporal analysis revealed that most DNA elements remain in chromatin hubs throughout differentiation. A subset of elements bound by MYOD1 in myoblasts exhibit early opening in a PBX1- and MEIS1-dependent manner.

We show that the identity of old ﬁbroblasts becomes undeﬁned, with the ﬁbroblast states present in young skin no longer clearly demarcated. In addition, old ﬁbroblasts not only reduce the expression of genes involved in the formation of the extracellular matrix, but also gain adipogenic traits, paradoxically becoming more similar to neonatal pro-adipogenic ﬁbroblasts. These alterations are sensitive to systemic metabolic changes: long-term caloric restriction reversibly prevents them, whereas a high-fat diet potentiates them. Our results therefore highlight loss of cell identity and the acquisition of adipogenic traits as a mechanism underlying cellular aging, which is inﬂuenced by systemic metabolism.},

Here, we use expressed DNA barcodes to clonally trace single cell transcriptomes dynamically during differentiation and apply this approach to the study of hematopoiesis. Our analysis identifies functional boundaries of cell potential early in the hematopoietic hierarchy and locates them on a continuous transcriptional landscape. Additionally, we find that the monocyte lineage differentiates through two distinct transcriptional and clonal routes, leaving a persistent imprint on mature cells. Finally, we use our approach to reflect on current methods of dynamics inference from single-cell snapshots. We find that for in vitro hematopoiesis, published fate prediction algorithms do not detect lineage priming in early progenitors, and provide evidence that there are hidden properties that influence cell fate but are not detectable with current single-cell sequencing methods.},

            A causal factor in mammalian aging is the accumulation of senescent cells (SnCs) with age. SnCs cause chronic inflammation, and removing SnCs decelerates aging in mice. Despite their importance, however, the production and removal rates of SnCs are not known, and their connection to aging dynamics is unclear. Here we use longitudinal SnC measurements and SnC induction experiments to show that SnCs turn over rapidly in young mice, with a half-life of days, but slow their own removal rate to a half-life of weeks in old mice. This leads to a critical slowing-down that generates persistent SnC fluctuations. We further demonstrate that a mathematical model, in which death occurs when fluctuating SnC populations cross a threshold, quantitatively recapitulates the Gompertz law of survival curves in mice and humans. The concept of a causal factor for aging with rapid turnover which slows its own removal can go beyond SnCs to explain the effects of interventions that modulate lifespan in
            Drosophila
            and
            C. elegans

In this work we provide a systematic description of diﬀerent processes that can give rise to zero values as well as the types of methods for addressing zeros in sequence count studies. Importantly, we systematically review how various models perform on each type of zero generating process. Our results demonstrate that zero-inﬂated models can have substantial biases in both simulated and real data settings. Additionally, we ﬁnd that zeros due to biological absences can, for many applications, be approximated as originating from under sampling.

CellMarker provides a userfriendly interface for browsing, searching and downloading markers of diverse cell types of different tissues. Furthermore, a summarized marker prevalence in each cell type is graphically and intuitively presented through a vivid statistical graph.

	abstract = {Transcriptional regulation in metazoans occurs through long-range genomic contacts between enhancers and promoters, and most genes are transcribed in episodic ‘‘bursts’’ of RNA synthesis. To understand the relationship between these two phenomena and the dynamic regulation of genes in response to upstream signals, we describe the use of live-cell RNA imaging coupled with Hi-C measurements and dissect the endogenous regulation of the estrogen-responsive TFF1 gene. Although TFF1 is highly induced, we observe short active periods and variable inactive periods ranging from minutes to days. The heterogeneity in inactive times gives rise to the widely observed ‘‘noise’’ in human gene expression and explains the distribution of protein levels in human tissue. We derive a mathematical model of regulation that relates transcription, chromosome structure, and the cell’s ability to sense changes in estrogen and predicts that hypervariability is largely dynamic and does not reﬂect a stable biological state.},

	abstract = {Formation of the three primary germ layers during gastrulation is an essential step in the establishment of the vertebrate body plan. Recent studies employing single cell RNA-sequencing have identified major transcriptional changes associated with germ layer specification. Global epigenetic reprogramming accompanies these changes, but the role of the epigenome in regulating early cell fate choice remains unresolved, and the coordination between different epigenetic layers is unclear. Here we describe the first single cell triple-omics map of chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation and RNA expression during the exit from pluripotency and the onset of gastrulation in mouse embryos. We find dynamic dependencies between the different molecular layers, with evidence for distinct modes of epigenetic regulation. The initial exit from pluripotency coincides with the establishment of a global repressive epigenetic landscape, followed by the emergence of local lineage-specific epigenetic patterns during gastrulation. Notably, cells committed to mesoderm and endoderm undergo widespread coordinated epigenetic rearrangements, driven by loss of methylation in enhancer marks and a concomitant increase of chromatin accessibility. In striking contrast, the epigenetic landscape of ectodermal cells is already established in the early epiblast. Hence, regulatory elements associated with each germ layer are either epigenetically primed or epigenetically remodelled prior to overt cell fate decisions during gastrulation, providing the molecular logic for a hierarchical emergence of the primary germ layers.},

We currently show that AA enjoys the interpretability of clustering –without being limited to hard assignment and the uniqueness of SVD – without being limited to orthogonal representations. In order to do large scale AA, we derive an efﬁcient algorithm based on projected gradient as well as an initialization procedure we denote FURTHESTSUM that is inspired by the FURTHESTFIRST approach widely used for K-means (Hochbaum and Shmoys, 1985 [14]). We generalize the AA procedure to KERNEL-AA in order to extract the principal convex hull in potential inﬁnite Hilbert spaces and derive a relaxation of AA when the archetypes cannot be represented as convex combinations of the observed data. We further demonstrate that the AA model is relevant for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction for a large variety of machine learning problems taken from computer vision, neuroimaging, chemistry, text mining and collaborative ﬁltering leading to highly interpretable representations of the dynamics in the data.

            Common approaches to gene signature discovery in single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) depend upon predefined structures like clusters or pseudo-temporal order, require prior normalization, or do not account for the sparsity of single cell data. We present single cell Hierarchical Poisson Factorization (scHPF), a Bayesian factorization method that adapts Hierarchical Poisson Factorization [1] for
            de novo
            discovery of both continuous and discrete expression patterns from scRNA-seq. scHPF does not require prior normalization and captures statistical properties of single cell data better than other methods in benchmark datasets. Applied to scRNA-seq of the core and margin of a high-grade glioma, scHPF uncovers marked differences in the abundance of glioma subpopulations across tumor regions and subtle, regionally-associated expression biases within glioma subpopulations. scHFP revealed an expression signature that was spatially biased towards the glioma-infiltrated margins and associated with inferior survival in glioblastoma.},

The origin of such continuum gene-expression patterns is unclear. To address this, we develop a theory to understand how a continuum provides division of labor in a tissue in which cells collectively contribute to several tasks. We ﬁnd that a continuum is optimal when there are spatial gradients in the tissue that affect the performance in each task. The continuum is bounded inside a polyhedron whose vertices are expression proﬁles optimal at each task. We test this using single-cell gene expression for intestinal villi and liver hepatocytes, which form a curved 1D trajectory and a full 3D tetrahedron in gene-expression space, respectively. We infer the tasks for both cell types and characterize the spatial zonation of the task-specialist cells. This approach can be generally applied to other tissues.},

The PWAA-EMD ﬁrst utilizes the EMD dissimilarity matrix to weight the coefﬁcient matrix in the regular Archetypal Analysis (AA). The EMD metric considers manifold structures of spectral signatures in the HSI data and could better quantify the dissimilarity features among pairwise pixels. Second, the PWAA-EMD adopts the Bayesian framework and formulates the improved AA into a probabilistic inference problem by maximizing a joint posterior density. Third, the optimization problem is solved by the iterative multiplicative update scheme, with a careful initialization from the two-stage algorithm and the proper endmembers are ﬁnally obtained. The synthetic and real Cuprite Hyperspectral datasets are utilized to verify the performance of PWAA-EMD and ﬁve popular methods are implemented to make comparisons. The results show that PWAA-EMD surpasses all the ﬁve methods in the average results of spectral angle distance (SAD) and root-mean-square-error (RMSE). Especially, the PWAA-EMD obtains more accurate estimation than AA in almost all the classes of endmembers including two similar ones. Therefore, the PWAA-EMD could be an alternative choice for endmember extraction on the hyperspectral data.},

We propose a new approach to archetypal analysis. Instead of ﬁtting a convex polytope directly on data or after a speciﬁc data transformation, we train a neural network (AAnet) to learn a transformation under which the data can best ﬁt into a polytope. We validate this approach on synthetic data where we add nonlinearity. Here, AAnet is the only method that correctly identiﬁes the archetypes. We also demonstrate AAnet on two biological datasets. In a T cell dataset measured with single cell RNA-sequencing, AAnet identiﬁes several archetypal states corresponding to naive, memory, and cytotoxic T cells. In a dataset of gut microbiome proﬁles, AAnet recovers both previously described microbiome states and identiﬁes novel extrema in the data. Finally, we show that AAnet has generative properties allowing us to uniformly sample from the data geometry even when the input data is not uniformly distributed.},

	abstract = {Single cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq) has transformed our ability to discover and annotate cell types and states, but deep biological understanding requires more than a taxonomic listing of clusters. As new methods arise to measure distinct cellular modalities, including high-dimensional immunophenotypes, chromatin accessibility, and spatial positioning, a key analytical challenge is to integrate these datasets into a harmonized atlas that can be used to better understand cellular identity and function. Here, we develop a computational strategy to “anchor” diverse datasets together, enabling us to integrate and compare single cell measurements not only across scRNA-seq technologies, but different modalities as well. After demonstrating substantial improvement over existing methods for data integration, we anchor scRNA-seq experiments with scATAC-seq datasets to explore chromatin differences in closely related interneuron subsets, and project single cell protein measurements onto a human bone marrow atlas to annotate and characterize lymphocyte populations. Lastly, we demonstrate how anchoring can harmonize

            gene expression and scRNA-seq datasets, allowing for the transcriptome-wide imputation of spatial gene expression patterns, and the identification of spatial relationships between mapped cell types in the visual cortex. Our work presents a strategy for comprehensive integration of single cell data, including the assembly of harmonized references, and the transfer of information across datasets.

In the cerebral cortex, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revealed the genome-wide expression patterns that define its many, closely related cell types, but cannot reveal their spatial arrangement. Here we introduce
            probabilistic cell typing by in situ sequencing
            (pciSeq), an approach that leverages prior scRNA-seq classification to identify cell types using multiplexed
            in situ
            RNA detection. We applied this method to map the inhibitory neurons of hippocampal area CA1, a cell system critical for memory function, for which ground truth is available from extensive prior work identifying the laminar organization of subtly differing cell types. Our method confidently identified 16 interneuron classes, in a spatial arrangement closely matching ground truth. This method will allow identifying the spatial organization of fine cell types across the brain and other tissues.},

	abstract = {SUMMARY
          
            Transcriptional profiling has revealed a diverse range of cancer cell states, however an understanding of their function has remained elusive. Using a combination of zebrafish melanoma modeling and human validation, we have identified a conserved stress-like state that confers intrinsic drug resistance. The stress-like state expresses genes such as
            fos
            ,
            hsp70
            and
            ubb
            , all required for adaptation to diverse cellular stresses, and we confirmed its existence using immunofluorescence and spatial transcriptomics. We provide evidence that this state has a higher tumor seeding capabilities compared to non-stressed cells, and confers intrinsic resistance to MEK inhibitors, a commonly used melanoma therapeutic. Furthermore, the stress-like program can be induced by extrinsic processes such as heat shock, and confers resistance to both MEK and BRAF inhibitors in both zebrafish and human melanomas. Collectively, our study suggests that the transcriptional states associated with therapeutic failure are established during the earliest steps of tumorigenesis.},

We leverage somatic mtDNA mutations as natural genetic barcodes and demonstrate their utility as highly accurate clonal markers to infer cellular relationships. We track native human cells both in vitro and in vivo and relate clonal dynamics to gene expression and chromatin accessibility. Our approach should allow clonal tracking at a 1,000-fold greater scale than with nuclear genome sequencing, with simultaneous information on cell state, opening the way to chart cellular dynamics in human health and disease.},

Spatially barcoded reverse transcription oligonucleotides are coupled to beads that are then randomly deposited in individual wells on a slide. The barcoded beads are decoded and coupled to a specific spatial address. We then capture and spatially in situ label RNA from the same histological tissue sections placed on the bead array slide. HDST recovers hundreds of thousands of transcript-coupled barcodes per experiment at 2 µm resolution. We demonstrate HDST in the mouse brain, use it to resolve spatial expression patterns and cell types, and show how to combine it with histological stains to relate expression patterns to tissue architecture and anatomy. HDST opens the way to 2D spatial analysis of tissues at high resolution.},

	abstract = {Gene expression is subject to stochastic noise, but to what extent and by which means such stochastic variations are coordinated among different genes are unclear. We hypothesize that neighboring genes on the same chromosome co-fluctuate in expression because of their common chromatin dynamics, and verify it at the genomic scale using allele-specific single-cell RNA-sequencing data of mouse cells. Unexpectedly, the co-fluctuation extends to genes that are over 60 million bases apart. We provide evidence that this long-range effect arises in part from chromatin co-accessibilities of linked loci attributable to three-dimensional proximity, which is much closer intra-chromosomally than inter-chromosomally. We further show that genes encoding components of the same protein complex tend to be chromosomally linked, likely resulting from natural selection for intracellular among-component dosage balance. These findings have implications for both the evolution of genome organization and optimal design of synthetic genomes in the face of gene expression noise.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is the second largest cause of cancer death among U.S. women and the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several genetic variants associated with susceptibility to breast cancer, but these still explain less than half of the estimated genetic contribution to the disease. Combinations of variants (i.e. genetic interactions) may play an important role in breast cancer susceptibility. However, due to a lack of statistical power, the current tests for genetic interactions from GWAS data mainly leverage prior knowledge to focus on small sets of genes or SNPs that are known to have an association with breast cancer. Thus, many genetic interactions, particularly among novel variants, remain understudied. Reversegenetic interaction screens in model organisms have shown that genetic interactions frequently cluster into highly structured motifs, where members of the same pathway share similar patterns of genetic interactions. Based on this key observation, we recently developed a method called BridGE to search for such structured motifs in genetic networks derived from GWAS studies and identify pathway-level genetic interactions in human populations. We applied BridGE to six independent breast cancer cohorts and identified significant pathway-level interactions in five cohorts. Joint analysis across all five cohorts revealed a high confidence consensus set of genetic interactions with support in multiple cohorts. The discovered interactions implicated the glutathione conjugation, vitamin D receptor, purine metabolism, mitotic prometaphase, and steroid hormone biosynthesis pathways as major modifiers of breast cancer risk. Notably, while many of the pathways identified by BridGE show clear relevance to breast cancer, variants in these pathways had not been previously discovered by traditional single variant association tests, or single pathway enrichment analysis that does not consider SNP-SNP interactions.},

Investigation of published data of technical controls in droplet based single cell RNA-seq experiments demonstrates the number of zeros in the data is consistent with count statistics, indicating that over-abundances of zero-values in biological data are likely due to biological variation as opposed to technical shortcomings.},

	url = {http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/586859},
	abstract = {The reference human interactome has been instrumental in the systems-level study of the molecular inner workings of the cell, providing a framework to analyze the network context of disease associated gene perturbations. However, reference organismal interactomes do not capture the tissue- and cell type-specific context in which proteins and modules preferentially act. Emerging single-cell profiling technologies, which survey the transcriptional cell-state distribution of complex tissues, could be used to infer the single-cell context of gene interactions. Here we introduce SCINET (Single-Cell Imputation and NETwork construction), a computational framework that reconstructs an ensemble of cell type-specific interactomes by integrating a global, context-independent reference interactome with a single-cell gene expression profile. SCINET addresses technical challenges of single-cell data by robustly imputing, transforming, and normalizing the initially noisy and sparse expression data. Subsequently, cell-level gene interaction probabilities and group-level gene interaction strengths are computed, resulting in cell type specific interactomes. We use SCINET to analyze the human cortex, reconstructing interactomes for the major cell types of the adult human brain. We identify network neighborhoods composed of topologically-specific genes that are central for cell-type influence but not for global interactome connectivity. We use the reconstructed interactomes to analyze the specificity and modularity of perturbations associated with neurodegenerative, neuropsychiatric, and neoplastic brain disorders; finding high variability across diseases, yet overall consistency in patterns of cell-type convergence for diseases of the same group. We infer for each disorder group disease gene networks with preferential cell-type specific activity that can aid the design and interpretation of cell-type resolution experiments. Finally, focusing on the pleiotropy of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, we show how cell type specific interactomes enable the identification of disease genes with preferential influence on neuronal, glial, or glial-neuronal cells. The SCINET framework is applicable to any organism, cell-type/tissue, and reference network; it is freely available at h ttps://github.com/shmohammadi86/SCINET.},

	abstract = {Regeneration requires both potential and instructions for tissue replacement. In planarians, pluripotent stem cells have the potential to produce all new tissue. The identities of the cells that provide regeneration instructions are unknown. Here, we report that position control genes (PCGs) that control regeneration and tissue turnover are expressed in a subepidermal layer of nonneoblast cells. These subepidermal cells coexpress many PCGs. We propose that these subepidermal cells provide a system of body coordinates and positional information for regeneration, and identify them to be muscle cells of the planarian body wall. Almost all planarian muscle cells express PCGs, suggesting a dual function: contraction and control of patterning. PCG expression is dynamic in muscle cells after injury, even in the absence of neoblasts, suggesting that muscle is instructive for regeneration. We conclude that planarian regeneration involves two highly ﬂexible systems: pluripotent neoblasts that can generate any new cell type and muscle cells that provide positional instructions for the regeneration of any body region.},

We adapted methods from molecular evolution and applied them to 7,664 tumors across 29 cancer types. Unlike species evolution, positive selection outweighs negative selection during cancer development. On average, {\textless}1 coding base substitution/tumor is lost through negative selection, with purifying selection almost absent outside homozygous loss of essential genes. This allows exome-wide enumeration of all driver coding mutations, including outside known cancer genes. On average, tumors carry \$4 coding substitutions under positive selection, ranging from {\textless}1/tumor in thyroid and testicular cancers to {\textgreater}10/tumor in endometrial and colorectal cancers. Half of driver substitutions occur in yet-to-be-discovered cancer genes. With increasing mutation burden, numbers of driver mutations increase, but not linearly. We systematically catalog cancer genes and show that genes vary extensively in what proportion of mutations are drivers versus passengers.},

We demonstrate our approach in several contexts, including simulated, yeast microarray, and human lymphoblastoid cell line RNA-seq data. We use these sample-specific networks to study changes in network topology across time and to characterize shifts in gene regulation that were not apparent in the expression data. We believe generating sample-specific networks will greatly facilitate the application of network methods to large, complex, and heterogeneous multi-omic data sets, supporting the emerging field of precision network medicine.},

          Elucidating the cellular architecture of the human neocortex is central to understanding our cognitive abilities and susceptibility to disease. Here we applied single nucleus RNA-sequencing to perform a comprehensive analysis of cell types in the middle temporal gyrus of human cerebral cortex. We identify a highly diverse set of excitatory and inhibitory neuronal types that are mostly sparse, with excitatory types being less layer-restricted than expected. Comparison to a similar mouse cortex single cell RNA-sequencing dataset revealed a surprisingly well-conserved cellular architecture that enables matching of homologous types and predictions of human cell type properties. Despite this general conservation, we also find extensive differences between homologous human and mouse cell types, including dramatic alterations in proportions, laminar distributions, gene expression, and morphology. These species-specific features emphasize the importance of directly studying human brain.},

Similar to how a reference genome sequence recently revolutionized human genetics, a reference map of the human interactome network is critical to fully understand genotype-phenotype relationships. Here, we present the first human “all-by-all” binary reference interactome map, or “HuRI”. With {\textasciitilde}53,000 high-quality protein-protein interactions (PPIs), HuRI is approximately four times larger than the information curated from small-scale studies available in the literature. Integrating HuRI with genome, transcriptome and proteome data enables the study of cellular function within essentially any physiological or pathological cellular context. We demonstrate the use of HuRI in identifying specific subcellular roles of PPIs and protein function modulation via splicing during brain development. Inferred tissue-specific networks reveal general principles for the formation of cellular context-specific functions and elucidate potential molecular mechanisms underlying tissue-specific phenotypes of Mendelian diseases. HuRI thus represents an unprecedented, systematic reference linking genomic variation to phenotypic outcomes.},

            Noise in gene expression is one of the hallmarks of life at the molecular scale. Here we derive analytical solutions to a set of models describing the molecular mechanisms underlying transcription of DNA into RNA. Our
            Ansatz
            allows us to incorporate the effects of extrinsic noise – encompassing factors external to the transcription of the individual gene – and discuss the ramifications for heterogeneity in gene product abundance that has been widely observed in single cell data. Crucially, we are able to show that heavy-tailed distributions of RNA copy numbers cannot result from the intrinsic stochasticity in gene expression alone, but must instead reflect extrinsic sources of variability.},

            platforms for evaluation and validation. Simulated datasets which resemble the properties of real datasets can aid in method development and prioritization as well as in questions in experimental design by providing an objective ground truth. Here, we present SymSim, a simulator software that explicitly models the processes that give rise to data observed in single cell RNA-Seq experiments. The components of the SymSim pipeline pertain to the three primary sources of variation in single cell RNA-Seq data: noise intrinsic to the process of transcription, extrinsic variation that is indicative of different cell states (both discrete and continuous), and technical variation due to low sensitivity and measurement noise and bias. Unlike other simulators, the parameters that govern the simulation process directly represent meaningful properties such as mRNA capture rate, the number of PCR cycles, sequencing depth, or the use of unique molecular identifiers. We demonstrate how SymSim can be used for benchmarking methods for clustering and differential expression and for examining the effects of various parameters on their performance. We also show how SymSim can be used to evaluate the number of cells required to detect a rare population and how this number deviates from the theoretical lower bound as the quality of the data decreases. SymSim is publicly available as an R package and allows users to simulate datasets with desired properties or matched with experimental data.},

The proposed method is an extension of linear “Archetypal Analysis” (AA), an unsupervised method to represent multivariate data points as sparse convex combinations of extremal elements of the dataset. Unlike the original formulation of AA, “Deep AA” can also handle side information and provides the ability for data-driven representation learning which reduces the dependence on expert knowledge. Our method is motivated by studies of evolutionary trade-oﬀs in biology where archetypes are species highly adapted to a single task. Along these lines, we demonstrate that “Deep AA” also lends itself to the supervised exploration of chemical space, marking a distinct starting point for de novo molecular design. In the unsupervised setting we show how “Deep AA” is used on CelebA to identify archetypal faces. These can then be superimposed in order to generate new faces which inherit dominant traits of the archetypes they are based on.},

Count statistics are used to estimate a peak transcription level for each gene, and a probability for the gene to be active in any given cell. We ﬁnd that the peak transcription levels are approximately constant across diﬀerent tissue types, but the gene expression probabilities may be markedly diﬀerent. Both these quantities have very wide ranges of values, with a probability density function well approximated by a power law.},

	abstract = {Somatic mutations acquired in healthy tissues as we age are major determinants of cancer risk. Whether variants confer a fitness advantage or rise to detectable frequencies by chance, however, remains largely unknown. Here, by combining blood sequencing data from ∼50,000 individuals, we reveal how mutation, genetic drift and fitness differences combine to shape the genetic diversity of healthy blood (‘clonal haematopoiesis’). By analysing the spectrum of variant allele frequencies we quantify fitness advantages for key pathogenic variants and genes and provide bounds on the number of haematopoietic stem cells. Positive selection, not drift, is the major force shaping clonal haematopoiesis. The remarkably wide variation in variant allele frequencies observed across individuals is driven by chance differences in the timing of mutation acquisition combined with differences in the cell-intrinsic fitness effect of variants. Contrary to the widely held view that clonal haematopoiesis is driven by ageing-related alterations in the stem cell niche, the data are consistent with the age dependence being driven simply by continuing risk of mutations and subsequent clonal expansions that lead to increased detectability at older ages.},

However, most experimental protocols for spatial transcriptomics suffer from the need to select beforehand a small fraction of genes to be quantified over the entire transcriptome. Standard single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is more prevalent, easier to implement and can in principle capture any gene but cannot recover the spatial location of the cells. In this manuscript, we focus on the problem of imputation of missing genes in spatial transcriptomic data based on (unpaired) standard scRNA-seq data from the same biological tissue. Building upon domain adaptation work, we propose gimVI, a deep generative model for the integration of spatial transcriptomic data and scRNA-seq data that can be used to impute missing genes. After describing our generative model and an inference procedure for it, we compare gimVI to alternative methods from computational biology or domain adaptation on real datasets and outperform Seurat Anchors, Liger and CORAL to impute held-out genes.},

	abstract = {Background: Single-cell gene expression measurements offer opportunities in deriving mechanistic understanding of complex diseases, including cancer. However, due to the complex regulatory machinery of the cell, gene regulatory network (GRN) model inference based on such data still manifests significant uncertainty.
Results: The goal of this paper is to develop optimal classification of single-cell trajectories accounting for potential model uncertainty. Partially-observed Boolean dynamical systems (POBDS) are used for modeling gene regulatory networks observed through noisy gene-expression data. We derive the exact optimal Bayesian classifier (OBC) for binary classification of single-cell trajectories. The application of the OBC becomes impractical for large GRNs, due to computational and memory requirements. To address this, we introduce a particle-based single-cell classification method that is highly scalable for large GRNs with much lower complexity than the optimal solution.
Conclusion: The performance of the proposed particle-based method is demonstrated through numerical experiments using a POBDS model of the well-known T-cell large granular lymphocyte (T-LGL) leukemia network with noisy time-series gene-expression data.},

Leveraging multiple sources of information, such as publicly available gene expression datasets, could therefore be helpful when learning a network of interest. Integrating data across different studies, however, raises numerous technical concerns. Hence, a common approach in network inference, and broadly in genomics research, is to separately learn models from each dataset and combine the results. Individual models, however, often suffer from under-sampling, poor generalization and limited network recovery. In this study, we explore previous integration strategies, such as batch-correction and model ensembles, and introduce a new multitask learning approach for joint network inference across several datasets. Our method initially estimates the activities of transcription factors, and subsequently, infers the relevant network topology. As regulatory interactions are context-dependent, we estimate model coefficients as a combination of both dataset-specific and conserved components. In addition, adaptive penalties may be used to favor models that include interactions derived from multiple sources of prior knowledge including orthogonal genomics experiments. We evaluate generalization and network recovery using examples from Bacillus subtilis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and show that sharing information across models improves network reconstruction. Finally, we demonstrate robustness to both false positives in the prior information and heterogeneity among datasets.},

To leverage these advantages, we developed a method for transcriptionally barcoding gene deletion mutants and performing scRNAseq in budding yeast (S accharomyces cerevisiae). We pooled diverse genotypes in 11 different environmental conditions and determined their expression state by sequencing 38,285 individual cells. We developed, and benchmarked, a framework for learning gene regulatory networks from scRNAseq data that incorporates multitask learning and constructed a global gene regulatory network comprising 12,018 interactions.

SCoPE2 uses data-driven analytics to optimize instrument parameters for sampling more ion copies per protein, thus supporting quantiﬁcation with improved count statistics. These advances enabled us to analyze the emergence of cellular heterogeneity as homogeneous monocytes differentiated into macrophage-like cells in the absence of polarizing cytokines. We used SCoPE2 to quantify over 2,000 proteins in 356 single monocytes and macrophages in about 85 hours of instrument time, and the quantiﬁed proteins allowed us to discern single cells by cell type. Furthermore, the data uncovered a continuous gradient of proteome states for the macrophage-like cells, suggesting that macrophage heterogeneity may emerge even in the absence of polarizing cytokines.

We propose that most heritability is driven by weak trans-eQTL SNPs, whose effects are mediated through peripheral genes to impact the expression of core genes. In particular, if the core genes for a trait tend to be co-regulated, then the effects of peripheral variation can be ampliﬁed such that nearly all of the genetic variance is driven by weak trans effects.

By studying the distinct origins and developmental processes of the ureteric bud, which contains epithelial kidney progenitors that undergo branching morphogenesis and thereby plays a central role in orchestrating organ geometry, and neighboring mesenchymal nephron progenitors, we established a protocol for differential induction of each lineage from mouse and human PSCs. Importantly, reassembled organoids developed the inherent architectures of the embryonic kidney, including the peripheral progenitor niche and internally differentiated nephrons that were interconnected by a ramiﬁed ureteric epithelium. This selective induction and reassembly strategy will be a powerful approach to recapitulate organotypic architecture in PSC-derived organoids.},

Previous studies of native or engineered sequences have remained limited in scale. Here, we use random sequences as an alternative, allowing us to measure the expression output of over 100 million synthetic yeast promoters. Random sequences yield a broad range of reproducible expression levels, indicating that the fortuitous binding sites in random DNA are functional. From these data we learn models of transcriptional regulation that predict over 94\% of the expression driven from independent test data and nearly 89\% from sequences from yeast promoters. These models allow us to characterize the activity of TFs and their interactions with chromatin, and help refine cis-regulatory motifs. We find that strand, position, and helical face preferences of TFs are widespread and depend on interactions with neighboring chromatin. Such massive-throughput regulatory assays of random DNA provide the diverse examples necessary to learn complex models of cisregulatory logic.},

Further, Bayesian techniques allow us to automatically estimate the dimensionality of the latent spaces. The model is capable of capturing structure underlying extremely high dimensional spaces. This is illustrated by modelling unprocessed images with tenths of thousands of pixels. This also allows us to directly generate novel images from the trained model by sampling from the discovered latent spaces. We also demonstrate the model by prediction of human pose in an ambiguous setting. Our Bayesian framework allows us to perform disambiguation in a principled manner by including latent space priors which incorporate the dynamic nature of the data.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            The striatum is a large brain region containing two major cell types: D1 (dopamine receptor 1) and D2 (dopamine receptor 2) expressing spiny projection neurons (SPNs). We generated a cell type atlas of the adult murine striatum using single-cell RNA-seq of SPNs combined with quantitative RNA
            in situ
            hybridization (ISH). We developed a novel computational pipeline that distinguishes discrete versus continuous cell identities in scRNA-seq data, and used it to show that SPNs in the striatum can be classified into four discrete types that reside in discrete anatomical clusters or are spatially intermingled. Within each discrete type, we find multiple independent axes of continuous cell identity that map to spatial gradients and whose genes are conserved between discrete types. These gradients correlate well to previously-mapped gradients of connectivity. Using these insights, we discovered multiple novel spatially localized region of the striatum, one of which contains patch-D2 SPNs that express
            Tac1, Htr7
            , and
            Th
            . Intriguingly, we found one subtype that strongly co-expresses both D1 and D2 dopamine receptors, and uniquely expresses a rare D2 receptor splice variant. These results collectively suggest an organizational principal of neuron identity in which major neuron types can be separated into discrete classes with little overlap and no implied spatial relationship. However these discrete classes are then continuously subdivided by multiple spatial gradients of expression defining anatomical location via a combinatorial mechanism. Finally, they suggest that neuronal circuitry has a substructure at far higher resolution than is typically interrogated which is defined by the precise identity and location of a neuron.},

	abstract = {Gene expression measurements are influenced by a wide range of factors, such as the state of the cell, experimental conditions and variants in the sequence of regulatory regions. To understand the effect of a variable of interest, such as the genotype of a locus, it is important to account for variation that is due to confounding causes. Here, we present VBQTL, a probabilistic approach for mapping expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) that jointly models contributions from genotype as well as known and hidden confounding factors. VBQTL is implemented within an efficient and flexible inference framework, making it fast and tractable on large-scale problems. We compare the performance of VBQTL with alternative methods for dealing with confounding variability on eQTL mapping datasets from simulations, yeast, mouse, and human. Employing Bayesian complexity control and joint modelling is shown to result in more precise estimates of the contribution of different confounding factors resulting in additional associations to measured transcript levels compared to alternative approaches. We present a threefold larger collection of cis eQTLs than previously found in a whole-genome eQTL scan of an outbred human population. Altogether, 27\% of the tested probes show a significant genetic association in cis, and we validate that the additional eQTLs are likely to be real by replicating them in different sets of individuals. Our method is the next step in the analysis of high-dimensional phenotype data, and its application has revealed insights into genetic regulation of gene expression by demonstrating more abundant cis-acting eQTLs in human than previously shown.

	abstract = {SUMMARY
          The bone marrow (BM) constitutes the primary site for life-long blood production and skeletal regeneration. However, its cellular composition and the spatial organization into distinct ‘niches’ remains controversial. Here, we combine single-cell and spatially resolved transcriptomics to systematically map the molecular and cellular composition of the endosteal, sinusoidal, and arteriolar BM niches. This allowed us to transcriptionally profile all major BM resident cell types, determine their localization, and clarify the cellular and spatial sources of key growth factors and cytokines. Our data demonstrate that previously unrecognized Cxcl12-abundant reticular (CAR) cell subsets (i.e. Adipo- and Osteo-CAR cells) differentially localize to sinusoidal or arteriolar surfaces, locally act as ‘professional cytokine secreting cells’, and thereby establish distinct peri-vascular micro-niches. Importantly, we also demonstrate that the 3-dimensional organization of the BM can be accurately inferred from single-cell gene expression data using the newly developed RNA-Magnet algorithm. Together, our study reveals the cellular and spatial organization of BM niches, and offers a novel strategy to dissect the complex organization of whole organs in a systematic manner.

It adapts the dimensionality of the latent components to the data, only requires iteration over the user/item pairs that have been rated, and has computational complexity on the same order as for a parametric model with ﬁxed dimensionality. We studied our model and algorithm with large realworld data sets of user-movie preferences. Our model eases the computational burden of searching for the number of latent components and gives better predictive performance than its parametric counterpart.},

	abstract = {Gaining a systematic molecular understanding of tissue physiology in health and disease will require the ability to rapidly profile the abundances of many genes at high resolution over large tissue volumes. Many current methods of imaging transcriptomics are based on single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization, with barcodes to allow multiplexing across genes. These approaches have serious limitations with respect to (i) the number of genes that can be studied and (ii) imaging time, due to the need for high-resolution to resolve individual signals. Here, we show that both challenges can be overcome by introducing an approach that leverages the biological fact that gene expression is often structured across both cells and tissue organization. We develop Composite In Situ Imaging (CISI), that combines this biological insight with algorithmic advances in compressed sensing to achieve greater efficiency. We demonstrate that CISI accurately recovers the spatial abundance of each of 37 individual genes in the mouse primary motor cortex (MOp) from 10 composite measurements and without the need for spot-level resolution. CISI achieves the current scale of multiplexing with an order of magnitude greater efficiency, and can be leveraged in combination with existing methods to multiplex far beyond current scales.},

However, within eukaryotes, the most popular algorithms consider only a restricted set of evolutionary events, typically modeling only duplications and losses or only coalescences. Recent work has uniﬁed duplications, losses, and coalescences through an intermediate locus tree; however, the associated reconciliation algorithms assume that the gene tree is known and do not account for gene tree reconstruction error. Here, we demonstrate that independent reconstruction of the gene tree followed by reconciliation substantially degrades accuracy compared to using the true gene tree. To address this challenge, we present DLC-Coestimation, a Bayesian method that simultaneously reconstructs the gene tree and reconciles it with the species tree. We have applied our method on two clades of ﬂies and fungi and demonstrate that it outperforms existing approaches in ortholog, duplication, and loss inference. This work demonstrates the utility of coestimation methods for inferences under joint phylogenetic and population genomic models.},

Using a combination of dynamic intravital imaging and confocal multiplex microscopy, we report here that tissue-resident macrophages rapidly sense the death of individual cells and extend membrane processes that sequester the damage, a process that prevents initiation of the feedforward chemoattractant signaling cascade that results in neutrophil swarms. Through this ‘‘cloaking’’ mechanism, the resident macrophages prevent neutrophil-mediated inﬂammatory damage, maintaining tissue homeostasis in the face of local cell injury that occurs on a regular basis in many organs because of mechanical and other stresses.},

	abstract = {Several tools analyze the outcome of single-cell RNA-seq experiments, and they often assume a probability distribution for the observed sequencing counts. It is an open question of which is the most appropriate discrete distribution, not only in terms of model estimation, but also regarding interpretability, complexity and biological plausibility of inherent assumptions. To address the question of interpretability, we investigate mechanistic transcription and degradation models underlying commonly used discrete probability distributions. Known bottom-up approaches infer steady-state probability distributions such as Poisson or Poisson-beta distributions from diﬀerent underlying transcription-degradation models. By turning this procedure upside down, we show how to infer a corresponding biological model from a given probability distribution, here the negative binomial distribution. Realistic mechanistic models underlying this distributional assumption are unknown so far. Our results indicate that the negative binomial distribution arises as steady-state distribution from a mechanistic model that produces mRNA molecules in bursts. We empirically show that it provides a convenient trade-oﬀ between computational complexity and biological simplicity.},

            Single-cell RNA sequencing studies into gene co-expression patterns could yield important new regulatory and functional insights, but have so far been limited by the confounding effects of cell differentiation and the cell cycle. We apply a tailored experimental design that eliminates these confounders, and report {\textgreater}80,000 intrinsically covarying gene pairs in mouse embryonic stem cells. These covariances form a network with biological properties, outlining known and novel gene interactions. We provide the first evidence that miRNAs naturally induce transcriptome-wide covariances, and compare the relative importance of nuclear organization, transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation in defining covariances. We find that nuclear organization has the greatest impact, and that genes encoding for physically interacting proteins specifically tend to covary, suggesting importance for protein complex stoichiometry. Our results lend support to the concept of post-transcriptional
            ‘RNA operons’
            , but we further present evidence that nuclear proximity of genes on the same or even distinct chromosomes also provides substantial functional regulation in mammalian single cells.},

In this paper, we benchmark diﬀerential expression methods against information-theoretic feature selection methods to evaluate the ability of these algorithms to identify small and eﬃcient sets of genes that are informative about cell types. Unlike diﬀerential methods, that are strictly binary and univariate, information-theoretic methods can be used as any combination of binary or multiclass and univariate or multivariate. We show for some datasets, information theoretic methods can reveal genes that are both distinct from those selected by traditional algorithms and that are as informative, if not more, of the class labels. We also present detailed and principled theoretical analyses of these algorithms.

In a breast cancer Imaging Mass Cytometry dataset, our model yields interpretable spatial variance signatures, which reveal cell-cell interactions as a major driver of protein expression heterogeneity. Applied to high-dimensional imaging-derived RNA data, SVCA identiﬁes plausible gene families that are linked to cell-cell interactions.

Optionally, SSAM can also integrate prior knowledge of cell types. We apply SSAM to three mouse brain tissue images: the somatosensory cortex imaged by osmFISH, the hypothalamic preoptic region by MERFISH, and the visual cortex by multiplexed smFISH. SSAM outperforms segmentation-based results, demonstrating that segmentation of cells is not required for inferring cell-type signatures, cell-type organization or tissue domains.},

We demonstrate the accuracy of DPGP in comparison to state-of-theart approaches using hundreds of simulated data sets. To further test our method, we apply DPGP to published microarray data from a microbial model organism exposed to stress and to novel RNA-seq data from a human cell line exposed to the glucocorticoid dexamethasone.

	abstract = {Topic models are one of the most popular methods for learning representations of text, but a major challenge is that any change to the topic model requires mathematically deriving a new inference algorithm. A promising approach to address this problem is autoencoding variational Bayes (AEVB), but it has proven difﬁcult to apply to topic models in practice. We present what is to our knowledge the ﬁrst effective AEVB based inference method for latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), which we call Autoencoded Variational Inference For Topic Model (AVITM). This model tackles the problems caused for AEVB by the Dirichlet prior and by component collapsing. We ﬁnd that AVITM matches traditional methods in accuracy with much better inference time. Indeed, because of the inference network, we ﬁnd that it is unnecessary to pay the computational cost of running variational optimization on test data. Because AVITM is black box, it is readily applied to new topic models. As a dramatic illustration of this, we present a new topic model called ProdLDA, that replaces the mixture model in LDA with a product of experts. By changing only one line of code from LDA, we ﬁnd that ProdLDA yields much more interpretable topics, even if LDA is trained via collapsed Gibbs sampling.},

We performed single-cell RNA sequencing using two independent platforms—SMART-seq (\$4,500 neurons) and 10x (\$78,000 neurons)—and investigated correspondence between transcriptomic identity and axonal projections or behavioral activation, respectively. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) identiﬁed 17 transcriptomic types (T-types), including several sexually dimorphic clusters, the majority of which were validated by seqFISH. Immediate early gene analysis identiﬁed T-types exhibiting preferential responses to intruder males versus females but only rare examples of behavior-speciﬁc activation. Unexpectedly, many VMHvl T-types comprise a mixed population of neurons with different projection target preferences. Overall our analysis revealed that, surprisingly, few VMHvl T-types exhibit a clear correspondence with behavior-speciﬁc activation and connectivity.},

Existing probabilistic approaches to interpreting these data either model all genes as zero-inﬂated, or none. But the overabundance of zeros might be gene-speciﬁc. Hence, we propose the AutoZI model, which, for each gene, places a spike-and-slab prior on a mixture assignment between a negative binomial (NB) component and a zero-inﬂated negative binomial (ZINB) component. We approximate the posterior distribution under this model using variational inference, and employ Bayesian decision theory to decide whether each gene is zero-inﬂated. On simulated data, AutoZI outperforms the alternatives. On negative control data, AutoZI retrieves predictions consistent to a previous study on ERCC spike-ins and recovers similar results on control RNAs. Applied to several datasets and instances of the 10x Chromium protocol, AutoZI allows both biological and technical interpretations of zero-inﬂation. Finally, AutoZI’s decisions on mouse embyronic stem-cells suggest that zero-inﬂation might be due to transcriptional bursting.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
          Single-cell RNA-sequencing has transformed our ability to examine cell fate choice. For example, in the context of development and differentiation, computational ordering of cells along ‘pseudotime’ enables the expression profiles of individual genes, including key transcription factors, to be examined at fine scale temporal resolution. However, while cell fate decisions are typically marked by profound changes in expression, many such changes are observed in genes downstream of the initial cell fate decision. By contrast, the genes directly involved in the cell fate decision process are likely to interact in subtle ways, potentially resulting in observed changes in patterns of correlation and variation rather than mean expression prior to cell fate commitment. Herein, we describe a novel approach, scHOT – single cell Higher Order Testing - which provides a flexible and statistically robust framework for identifying changes in higher order interactions among genes. scHOT is general and modular in nature, can be run in multiple data contexts such as along a continuous trajectory, between discrete groups, and over spatial orientations; as well as accommodate any higher order measurement such as variability or correlation. We demonstrate the utility of scHOT by studying embryonic development of the liver, where we find coordinated changes in higher order interactions of programs related to differentiation and liver function. We also demonstrate its ability to find subtle changes in gene-gene correlation patterns across space using spatially-resolved expression data from the mouse olfactory bulb. scHOT meaningfully adds to first order effect testing, such as differential expression, and provides a framework for interrogating higher order interactions from single cell data.},

	abstract = {As a typical latent factor model, Matrix Factorization (MF) has demonstrated its great effectiveness in recommender systems. Users and items are represented in a shared low-dimensional space so that the user preference can be modeled by linearly combining the item factor vector V using the user-speciﬁc coefﬁcients U . From a generative model perspective, U and V are drawn from two independent Gaussian distributions, which is not so faithful to the reality. Items are produced to maximally meet users’ requirements, which makes U and V strongly correlated. Meanwhile, the linear combination between U and V forces a bijection (one-to-one mapping), which thereby neglects the mutual correlation between the latent factors. In this paper, we address the upper drawbacks, and propose a new model, named Correlated Matrix Factorization (CMF). Technically, we apply Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to map U and V into a new semantic space. Besides achieving the optimal ﬁtting on the rating matrix, one component in each vector (U or V ) is also tightly correlated with every single component in the other. We derive efﬁcient inference and learning algorithms based on variational EM methods. The effectiveness of our proposed model is comprehensively veriﬁed on four public datasets. Experimental results show that our approach achieves competitive performance on both prediction accuracy and efﬁciency compared with the current state of the art.},

	abstract = {The mammalian nervous system executes complex behaviors controlled by specialized, precisely positioned, and interacting cell types. Here, we used RNA sequencing of half a million single cells to create a detailed census of cell types in the mouse nervous system. We mapped cell types spatially and derived a hierarchical, data-driven taxonomy. Neurons were the most diverse and were grouped by developmental anatomical units and by the expression of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. Neuronal diversity was driven by genes encoding cell identity, synaptic connectivity, neurotransmission, and membrane conductance. We discovered seven distinct, regionally restricted astrocyte types that obeyed developmental boundaries and correlated with the spatial distribution of key glutamate and glycine neurotransmitters. In contrast, oligodendrocytes showed a loss of regional identity followed by a secondary diversiﬁcation. The resource presented here lays a solid foundation for understanding the molecular architecture of the mammalian nervous system and enables genetic manipulation of speciﬁc cell types.},

	abstract = {Transcription factors (TFs) regulate many cellular processes and can therefore serve as readouts of the signaling and regulatory state. Yet for many TFs, the mode of action—repressing or activating transcription of target genes—is unclear. Here, we present diffTF (https://git.embl.de/grp-zaugg/ diffTF) to calculate differential TF activity (basic mode) and classify TFs into putative transcriptional activators or repressors (classiﬁcation mode). In basic mode, it combines genome-wide chromatin accessibility/activity with putative TF binding sites that, in classiﬁcation mode, are integrated with RNA-seq. We apply diffTF to compare (1) mutated and unmutated chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients and (2) two hematopoietic progenitor cell types. In both datasets, diffTF recovers most known biology and ﬁnds many previously unreported TFs. It classiﬁes almost 40\% of TFs based on their mode of action, which we validate experimentally. Overall, we demonstrate that diffTF recovers known biology, identiﬁes less well-characterized TFs, and classiﬁes TFs into transcriptional activators or repressors.},

            Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with increased risk of gastrointestinal cancers. Here, we whole-genome sequenced 447 colonic crypts from 46 IBD patients, and compared these to 412 crypts from 41 non-IBD controls. The average mutation rate of affected colonic epithelial cells is 2.4-fold that of healthy colon and this increase is mostly driven by acceleration of mutational processes ubiquitously observed in normal colon. In contrast to the normal colon, where clonal expansions outside the confines of the crypt are rare, we observed widespread millimeter-scale clonal expansions. We discovered non-synonymous mutations in
            ARID1A, FBXW7, PIGR and ZC3H12A,
            and genes in the interleukin 17 and Toll-like receptor pathways, under positive selection in IBD. These results suggest distinct selection mechanisms in the colitis-affected colon and that somatic mutations potentially play a causal role in IBD pathogenesis.},

	url = {http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2019.12.21.884759},
	abstract = {Methods: We have explored cellular heterogeneity of the human airway epithelium in 10 healthy living volunteers by single-cell RNA profiling. 77,969 cells were collected by bronchoscopy at 35 distinct locations, from the nose to the 12th division of the airway tree.
Results: The resulting atlas is composed of a high percentage of epithelial cells (89.1\%), but also immune (6.2\%) and stromal (4.7\%) cells with peculiar cellular proportions in different sites of the airways. It reveals differential gene expression between identical cell types (suprabasal, secretory, and multiciliated cells) from the nose (MUC4, PI3, SIX3) and tracheobronchial (SCGB1A1, TFF3) airways. By contrast, cell-type specific gene expression was stable across all tracheobronchial samples. Our atlas improves the description of ionocytes, pulmonary neuroendocrine (PNEC) and brush cells, which are likely derived from a common population of precursor cells. We also report a population of KRT13 positive cells with a high percentage of dividing cells which are reminiscent of “hillock” cells previously described in mouse.
Conclusions: Robust characterization of this unprecedented large single-cell cohort establishes an important resource for future investigations. The precise description of the continuum existing from nasal epithelium to successive divisions of lung airways and the stable gene expression profile of these regions better defines conditions under which relevant tracheobronchial proxies of human respiratory diseases can be developed.},

	abstract = {The adoption of deep learning techniques in genomics has been hindered by the difﬁculty of mechanistically interpreting the models that these techniques produce. In recent years, a variety of post-hoc attribution methods have been proposed for addressing this neural network interpretability problem in the context of gene regulation. Here we describe a complementary way of approaching this problem. Our strategy is based on the observation that two large classes of biophysical models of cis-regulatory mechanisms can be expressed as deep neural networks in which nodes and weights have explicit physiochemical interpretations. We also demonstrate how such biophysical networks can be rapidly inferred, using modern deep learning frameworks, from the data produced by certain types of massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs). These results suggest a scalable strategy for using MPRAs to systematically characterize the biophysical basis of gene regulation in a wide range of biological contexts. They also highlight gene regulation as a promising venue for the development of scientiﬁcally interpretable approaches to deep learning.},

Starting from a few basic requirements such as that inferred expression states should correct for both intrinsic biological ﬂuctuations and measurement noise, and that changes in expression state should be measured in terms of fold-changes rather than changes in absolute levels, we here derive a unique Bayesian procedure for normalizing single-cell RNA-seq data from ﬁrst principles. Our implementation of this normalization procedure, called Sanity (SAmpling Noise corrected Inference of Transcription activitY), estimates log expression values and associated errors bars directly from raw UMI counts without any tunable parameters.},

	abstract = {Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) quantiﬁes the gene expression of individual cells in a sample, which allows distinct cell-type populations to be identiﬁed and characterized. An important step in many scRNA-seq analysis pipelines is the classiﬁcation of cells into known cell-types. While this can be achieved using experimental techniques, such as ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting, these approaches are impractical for large numbers of cells. This motivates the development of data-driven cell-type identiﬁcation methods. We ﬁnd limitations with current approaches due to the reliance on known marker genes and sensitivity to the quality of reference samples. Here we present a computationally light statistical approach, based on Naive Bayes, that leverages public datasets to combine information across thousands of genes and probabilistically assign cell-type identity. Using datasets ranging across species and tissue types, we demonstrate that our approach is robust to low-quality reference data and produces more accurate cell-type identiﬁcation than current methods.},

	abstract = {Background: Large-scale single-cell transcriptomic datasets generated using different technologies contain batchspecific systematic variations that present a challenge to batch-effect removal and data integration. With continued growth expected in scRNA-seq data, achieving effective batch integration with available computational resources is crucial. Here, we perform an in-depth benchmark study on available batch correction methods to determine the most suitable method for batch-effect removal.
Results: We compare 14 methods in terms of computational runtime, the ability to handle large datasets, and batch-effect correction efficacy while preserving cell type purity. Five scenarios are designed for the study: identical cell types with different technologies, non-identical cell types, multiple batches, big data, and simulated data. Performance is evaluated using four benchmarking metrics including kBET, LISI, ASW, and ARI. We also investigate the use of batch-corrected data to study differential gene expression.
Conclusion: Based on our results, Harmony, LIGER, and Seurat 3 are the recommended methods for batch integration. Due to its significantly shorter runtime, Harmony is recommended as the first method to try, with the other methods as viable alternatives.},

	abstract = {Many biological applications require the segmentation of cell bodies, membranes and nuclei from microscopy images. Deep learning has enabled great progress on this problem, but current methods are specialized for images that have large training datasets. Here we introduce a generalist, deep learning-based segmentation method called Cellpose, which can precisely segment cells from a wide range of image types and does not require model retraining or parameter adjustments. We trained Cellpose on a new dataset of highly-varied images of cells, containing over 70,000 segmented objects. We also demonstrate a 3D extension of Cellpose which reuses the 2D model and does not require 3D-labelled data. To support community contributions to the training data, we developed software for manual labelling and for curation of the automated results, with optional direct upload to our data repository. Periodically retraining the model on the community-contributed data will ensure that Cellpose improves constantly.},

Here, we present CellOracle, a computational tool that integrates single-cell transcriptome and epigenome profiles, integrating prior biological knowledge via regulatory sequence analysis to infer GRNs. Application of these inferred GRNs to the simulation of gene expression changes in response to transcription factor (TF) perturbation enables network configurations to be interrogated in silico, facilitating their interpretation. Here, we benchmark CellOracle against ground-truth TF-gene interactions and demonstrate its efficacy to recapitulate known regulatory changes across hematopoiesis, correctly predicting well-characterized phenotypic changes in response to TF perturbations. Application of CellOracle to direct lineage reprogramming reveals distinct network configurations underlying different modes of reprogramming failure. Furthermore, analysis of GRN reconfiguration along successful cell fate conversion trajectories identifies new factors to enhance target cell yield. We validate these CellOracle predictions experimentally and highlight a putative role for AP-1-Yap1 in reprogramming. Together, these results demonstrate the efficacy of CellOracle to infer and interpret cell-type-specific GRN configurations, at highresolution, enabling new mechanistic insights into the regulation and reprogramming of cell identity.

	abstract = {Tissues are complex systems of interacting cell types. Knowing cell-type proportions in a tissue is very important to identify which cells or cell types are targeted by a disease or perturbation. When measuring such responses using RNA-seq, bulk RNA-seq masks cellular heterogeneity. Hence, several computational methods have been proposed to infer cell-type proportions from bulk RNA samples. Their performance with noisy reference proﬁles highly depends on the set of genes undergoing deconvolution. These genes are often selected based on prior knowledge or a single-criterion test that might not be useful to dissect closely correlated cell types. In this work, we introduce AutoGeneS, a tool that automatically extracts informative genes and reveals the cellular heterogeneity of bulk RNA samples. AutoGeneS requires no prior knowledge about marker genes and selects genes by simultaneously optimizing multiple criteria: minimizing the correlation and maximizing the distance between cell types. It can be applied to reference proﬁles from various sources like single-cell experiments or sorted cell populations. Results from human samples of peripheral blood illustrate that AutoGeneS outperforms other methods. Our results also highlight the impact of our approach on analyzing bulk RNA samples with noisy single-cell reference proﬁles and closely correlated cell types. Ground truth cell proportions analyzed by ﬂow cytometry conﬁrmed the accuracy of the predictions of AutoGeneS in identifying cell-type proportions. AutoGeneS is available for use via a standalone Python package (https://github.com/theislab/AutoGeneS).},

          We have produced RNA sequencing data for a number of primary cells from different locations in the human body. The clustering of these primary cells reveals that most cells in the human body share a few broad transcriptional programs, which define five major cell types: epithelial, endothelial, mesenchymal, neural and blood cells. These act as basic components of many tissues and organs. Based on gene expression, these cell types redefine the basic histological types by which tissues have been traditionally classified. We identified genes whose expression is specific to these cell types, and from these genes, we estimated the contribution of the major cell types to the composition of human tissues. We found this cellular composition to be a characteristic signature of tissues, and to reflect tissue morphological heterogeneity and histology. We identified changes in cellular composition in different tissues associated with age and sex and found that departures from the normal cellular composition correlate with histological phenotypes associated to disease.

	abstract = {Single-cell technology has opened the door for studying signal transduction in a complex tissue at unprecedented resolution. However, there is a lack of analytical methods for de novo construction of signal transduction pathways using single-cell omics data. Here we present CytoTalk, a computational method for de novo constructing cell type-specific signal transduction networks using single-cell RNASeq data. CytoTalk first constructs intracellular and intercellular gene-gene interaction networks using an information-theoretic measure between two cell types. Candidate signal transduction pathways in the integrated network are identified using the prizecollecting Steiner forest algorithm. We applied CytoTalk to a single-cell RNA-Seq data set on mouse visual cortex and evaluated predictions using high-throughput spatial transcriptomics data generated from the same tissue. Compared to published methods, genes in our inferred signaling pathways have significantly higher spatial expression correlation only in cells that are spatially closer to each other, suggesting improved accuracy of CytoTalk. Furthermore, using single-cell RNA-Seq data with receptor gene perturbation, we found that predicted pathways are enriched for differentially expressed genes between the receptor knockout and wild type cells, further validating the accuracy of CytoTalk. In summary, CytoTalk enables de novo construction of signal transduction pathways and facilitates comparative analysis of these pathways across tissues and conditions.},
