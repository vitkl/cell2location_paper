## Cell2location paper - Comprehensive mapping of tissue cell architecture via integrated single cell and spatial transcriptomics

This repository contains notebooks and scripts used in the paper and is aimed to show how the analysis was done. Reproducing the analysis requires additional steps such as downloading data, changing hard-coded paths, etc. Some notebooks will be updated shortly. 

For our latest tutorial on using cell2location please see https://cell2location.readthedocs.io/en/latest/, https://github.com/BayraktarLab/cell2location. The tutorial covers cell2location analysis needed to reproduce mouse brain figures in the paper (Visium data, Fig 2-3).

Abstract:
The spatial organization of cell types in tissues fundamentally shapes cellular interactions and function, but the high-throughput spatial mapping of complex tissues remains a challenge. We present сell2location, a principled and versatile Bayesian model that integrates single-cell and spatial transcriptomics to map cell types in situ in a comprehensive manner. We show that сell2location outperforms existing tools in accuracy and throughput and we demonstrate its utility by mapping two complex tissues. In the mouse brain, we use a new paired single nucleus and spatial RNA-sequencing dataset to map dozens of cell types and identify tissue regions in an automated manner. We discover novel regional astrocyte subtypes including fine subpopulations in the thalamus and hypothalamus. In the human lymph node, we resolve spatially interlaced immune cell states and identify co-located groups of cells underlying tissue organisation. We spatially map a rare pre-germinal centre B-cell population and predict putative cellular interactions relevant to the interferon response. Collectively our results demonstrate how сell2location can serve as a versatile first-line analysis tool to map tissue architectures in a high-throughput manner.
