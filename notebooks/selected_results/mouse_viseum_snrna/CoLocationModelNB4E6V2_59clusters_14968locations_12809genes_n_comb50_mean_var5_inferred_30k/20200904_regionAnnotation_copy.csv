0,0,0,0,thalamus,select thalamic nuclei,,most thalamus except medial nuclei and habenula,
1,1,1,1,cortex,pan cortex,L2/3,,
2,2,6,15,cortex,pan cortex,L1,could also be low quality - but I think the L1 was stripped off in this sample,
3,3,4,10,hypothalamus,dorsal,,dorsal hypothalamic nuclei outside region 6,
4,4,5,4,white matter,ventral,,mostly in cerebral peduncle - some in corpus callosum,
5,5,3,7,cortex,pan cortex,L6,maybe some L5,
6,6,2,5,cortex,pan cortex,L5,looks like upper L5 and likely includes full L5/6 in medial cortex,
7,7,7,12,white matter,dorsal,,"stria terminalis, corpus calllosum, fimbria - complementary to region 12",
8,8,17,20,cortex,lateral cortex (SS) ,L4,,
9,9,10,3,amygdala,basomedial,,,
10,10,11,-,piriform cortex,L1,,some L2-3,
11,11,8,11,hippocampus,,,"stronger in CA1, CA2, CA3 but also observed in DG",
12,12,12,17,striatum,caudate putamen,,,
13,6,2,5,cortex,pan cortex,L5,looks like upper L5 and likely includes full L5/6 in medial cortex,
14,14,14,8,thalamus,select thalamic nuclei,,ventral/medial thalamic nuclei outside region 0 and the habenula,
15,15,16,13,hypothalamus,dorsal,,"zona incerta, subthalamic nuclei (49) and also contains region immediately doroslateral to the hypothamus - perhaps globus pallidus internal segment or substantia innominata (48,52)",49
16,16,13,9,piriform cortex,L2-3,,,
17,17,21,13,thalamus,habenula,,lateral hebenula,
18,18,9,6,hypothalamus,ventral,,periventricular nucleus and more ventral areas - excludes zona incerta - could be split prpbably,
19,19,18,2,"pia, lateral ventricle",dorsal,,could be a low quality region or a pial/meninges cell type or ependyma,
20,20,19,18,cortex,pan cortex,L6,L6b - might be white matter - tough to say - check expression of L6b neuron vs white matter Oligodendrocyte markers,
21,21,24,-,thalamus,select thalamic nuclei,,"lateral nuclei - substantial in animal 2 section 51, 52",51
22,22,20,-,amygdala,posterior,,seems like posterior amygdalar,49
23,23,22,25,hippocampus,"CA2, CA3",,,
24,24,25,23,hippocampus,dentate gyrus,,,
25,25,23,-,thalamus,select thalamic nuclei,,"medial nuclei ventral to habenula - few spots in animal 1 but substantial in animal 2 section 51,52",51
26,26,28,21,hippocampus,CA1,,,
27,27,26,24,thalamus,select thalamic nuclei,,lateral - looks like reticular nucleus,
28,28,27,-,lateral ventricle,ventral,,could be a low quality region or a pial/meninges cell type or ependyma- can be merged with 18,
29,29,30,-,hypothalamus,ventral,,"ventromedial nuclei - not on animal 1 but clear on section 51,52",51
30,30,21,13,thalamus,habenula,,medial habenula,
,,NA,14,pia,ventral,,could be a low quality region or a pial/meninges cell type or ependyma,
,,NA,19,thalamus,select thalamic nuclei,,lateral nuclei - can group with region 0,
,,NA,22,hypothalamus,dorsomedial,,"complementray to region 6,10 and 13 - together they describe differnet hypothalamic nuclei",
